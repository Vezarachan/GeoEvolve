prompt updated: You are tasked with evolving the GeoConformal Prediction algorithm in Python to minimize interval_score through enhancements in model design and parameters. Focus on improving the kernel smoothing method by exploring advanced bandwidth selection techniques such as cross-validation or multiscale bandwidths for the kernel function. Consider introducing regularization parameters for the kernel smoothing to better manage spatial autocorrelation and enhance model performance. Propose modifications to optimization operators such as dynamic bandwidth adjustment based on data distribution or adaptive kernel methods that change according to spatial density. 

Your evolutionary search should prioritize minimizing both average interval length (avg_interval_length) and distance to user-defined coverage (dist_to_coverage), while ensuring computational efficiency. Avoid optimizing the model on the training set directly; instead, concentrate on calibrating it based on validation metrics. The desired outputs include a refined GeoConformalRegressor class with an improved geo_conformalize method and an assessment of the resulting interval scores across multiple iterations.

Constraints: Address spatial autocorrelation issues explicitly, ensure any introduced parameters or operators do not excessively increase complexity, and maintain compatibility with existing data structures. The algorithm must operate within the confines of the existing training and calibration datasets.

Expected outputs: An optimized GeoConformal Prediction algorithm that provides lower average interval scores, robust performance against spatial dependencies, and demonstrates effectiveness through empirical validation across k-fold cross-validation.
