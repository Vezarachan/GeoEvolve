Abstract
We introduce three adaptive time series learning methods, called Dynamic
Model Selection (DMS), Adaptive Ensemble (AE), and Dynamic Asset Alloca-
tion (DAA). The methods respectively handle model selection, ensembling,
and contextual evaluation in financial time series. Empirically, we use the
methods to forecast the returns of four key indices in the US market, incor-
porating information from the VIX and Yield curves. We present financial
applications of the learning results, including fully-automated portfolios and
dynamic hedging strategies. The strategies strongly outperform long-only
benchmarks over our testing period, spanning from Q4 2015 to the end of
2021. The key outputs of the learning methods are interpreted during the
2020 market crash.

INTRODUCTION
It is not wise to apply generically-developed machine learning meth-
ods in a time series environment. This is because of the unique na-
ture of time series, where observations are not i.i.d., but rather have
an ordered dependence structure and potential change-points. The
distribution of time series data at a certain time 𝑡may differ mas-
sively from some time far in the past. By adapting to past forecasting
errors in a time series context, Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) and
Adaptive Ensemble (AE) take a rolling view of model selection and
ensembling respectively. This differs from typical cross-validation
procedures, which attempt to find a single best model for testing,
rather than provide ongoing selections.
The DMS and AE approaches still face two problems: how to tune
the hyperparameters over time? And how to compare models that

forecast different variables or horizons? For instance, some assets
may be easier to forecast than others and shorter forecast horizons
may induce lower errors than longer ones. This motivates the third
algorithm, Dynamic Asset Allocation (DAA), which is a dynamic
evaluation mechanism based on Sharpe Ratio (SR). In this paper, we
apply all three algorithms to create automated portfolio strategies
and demonstrate their strong performance against benchmarks in
both return and risk metrics. We also demonstrate the interpretabil-
ity of our methods by obtaining the relevant information produced
by the algorithms, and further in conjunction with the market crash
in 2020.
1.1
Literature Review and Empirical Motivation
There are three branches of literature that the current study engages
with. The first is on the methodological side and relates to model se-
lection, where attention to time-variability is crucial. Time-varying
functional forms have been addressed in deep learning, for instance,
by extending traditional feedforward neural networks to LSTMs
[14], which are more suited to financial time series [19]. Time series
econometricians refer to this problem as "time-varying parameters"
[3, 13]. The field of change-point detection is also relevant, as it deals
with shifts in the underlying distribution of a time series [1, 10].
Adaptive time series methods are another set of attempts at time
series model selection, as [23, 24] demonstrate the possibility for
lag operators and window selection based on the loss induced by
the past forecasts. The DMS and AE methods directly relate to the
model selection and ensembling in a time series environment: the
loss functions and sample evaluation methods account for the usual
concerns of stability and interpretability while being engineered
specifically for time series.
The second branch is related to empirical risk minimization in the
statistical learning literature. In particular, robust statistics and fore-
casting theory [10–12, 15] play a role and motivate many potential
loss functions for AE and DMS. In addition to that, domain-specific
evaluation metrics in a change-point or contaminated environment
may differ hugely from traditional metrics such as Mean Squared

Error (MSE), and may be more robust instead. To this point, recent
literature demonstrates how financial metrics can be useful as a
contextual evaluation for various statistical or machine learning
models [2, 4, 16, 20]. Discussions on Sharpe Ratio (SR) as a statis-
tical measurement can be further traced to [17, 18]. Crucially, SR
serves not only as a tool for portfolio evaluation in finance, but
also as an evaluation metric for financial time series. This moti-
vates DAA to be introduced as a tool for dynamic and contextual
evaluation in financial time series. Combining the algorithms prac-
tically extends to the concept of automation, such as the proposal of
‘Automated Statistician’ [21]. In this paper, we extend our method
into a potential ‘Automated Portfolio Manager’, where the machine
learning aspect of the risk-minimisation process could be translated
to user-algorithm interaction in financial practice.
The final branch of literature concerns the empirical findings
from the Yield Curve, VIX Curve, and financial markets. There is a
large body of existing literature linking the Yield Curve to future
economic growth and many other important macroeconomic vari-
ables [5, 7], especially prior to the downturn of the economy. [23],
for example, finds empirical success in forecasting US GDP Growth
using the Yield Curve. Likewise, the VIX Curve has become widely
recognised amongst the practitioner community as an important
signal for the future state of the stock market [8, 9, 22]. Still, despite
numerous studies suggesting the existence of a relationship, a de-
tailed forecasting study has yet to be conducted; neither has a study
been done using non-traditional evaluation metrics and statistical
learning techniques. As an empirical observation, Figure 1 shows
the state of these relationships on 24 Feb 2020, demonstrating that
inversions of both curves can signal a downturn in the stock market.
We further this analysis and provide a case study on the 2020 market
crash.
1.2
Key Problems and Contributions
We state the following two problems we aim to tackle.
• Problem 1: In time series, like many other types of data, a com-
mon problem we face is how to select a set of models or combine
them. However, classic techniques such as cross-validation would
rely on certain notions of stability or stationarity in the distribu-
tion, whereas in time series, abrupt regime switches frequently
occur and disrupt the robustness of such a selection.
The problem is hence: what loss function and sample evaluation
method should be used to select the best parametric time series
model, and how to ensemble different models over time?
• Problem 2: For a portfolio manager, a common problem is how to
compare and select from competing models and trading strategies
subject to investment constraints. With the common evaluation
metrics such as MSE, we are restricted to compare predictive
models within the same variable and same forecast horizon: at
time 𝑡, let 𝑘1,𝑘2 > 0 while 𝑘1 ≠𝑘2, if we forecast 𝑌at time 𝑡+𝑘1
conditional on present (𝑌𝑡+𝑘1 |𝑡), the distribution of itself could be
quite different from the distribution of 𝑌at time 𝑡+ 𝑘2 (𝑌𝑡+𝑘2 |𝑡)
or another variable 𝑍at another time.
The problem becomes: how to compare and select from models
with different variables and forecasting horizons? Further, how
to automate such a process subject to investment constraints and
can this outperform the market?
Our key contributions in response to the above are as follows.
We propose two algorithms (DMS and AE) to respond to problem 1,
which serve as general procedures to select and combine models in
time series. We designed loss functions that are tailored to time series
data and forecasting. In particular, they weigh more heavily recent
forecasting errors, providing a more up-to-date evaluation. For mod-
els with a larger forecasting horizon, we also consider higher-order
forecasting information, such as the loss associated with forecasts
made on the intervening horizons.
As a response to problem 2, we propose an evaluation procedure
(DAA) to select the outperforming forecasts, for the purpose of
their induced financial performance — the use of SR allows that to
draw together different assets and compare across different forecast
horizons. Similar to the idea of an ‘automated statistician’ in the
recent literature, it is tempting to ask whether it is possible to have
an ‘automated portfolio manager’ selecting the top models amongst
different variables and forecasting horizons — DAA is a step forward
toward that agenda. More empirically, we address problem 2 by
using the aforementioned algorithms to select and invest in different
assets, with a number of variations such as capital constraints and
hedging. The latter also offers an up-to-date demonstration of the
usage of VIX as a hedging tool for speculation, which contributes
to the broader literature on portfolio management.
1.3
Plan of This Paper
We present the main algorithms in section 2, followed by empirical
financial results of the algorithms in sections 3 and 4. We also show
how the algorithms’ outputs can be interpreted by examining the
environment of 2020 market crash in section 5. Conclusions and
future plans are then made in section 6.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
We consider the problem of selecting from a set of parametric time
series models, denoted here by 𝐻. For example, 𝐻may contain
AR models up to certain lags, and also various models including
other explanatory variables. For each model ℎ∈𝐻, we have various
estimation techniques, e.g. MLE or Yule-Walker Method with various
window sizes (𝑤) which control the sample size of the parametric
estimation. We denote such a technique as Ξℎ,𝑖, where 𝑖∈𝐼(ℎ)
serves as an index.
2.1
Dynamic Model Selection
We first introduce the case of finding (ℎ∗, Ξ∗
ℎ,𝑖), the optimal model
and estimation technique pairing. We refer to this algorithm as
Dynamic Model Selection (DMS), and annotate the selected model
as ℎ𝐷𝑀𝑆∈𝐻. The key here is to select the model at time 𝑡and
adapt the forecast to the selected one. In particular, we use global
loss function ℓto facilitate the evaluation of the ‘goodness’ of the
model, therefore returning ^𝑦𝑡+𝑘|𝑡(ℎ𝐷𝑀𝑆).
Our approach is designed to find the model(s) with the lowest
loss, which is closely related to out-of-sample forecasting error.
We do so by considering various local loss functions and sample
evaluation methods (what can be thought of as the global loss func-
tion). Though this may be analogous to empirical risk minimization,
which is commonly implemented, we propose a variety of loss func-
tions aiming to achieve a more accurate model selection by robust

(a) For 𝜏∈{𝑡−𝑣0 + 1, ...,𝑡}, repeat:
(i) Evaluate ℓgiven the information required. Then find ℎ∗∈𝐻and Ξ∗
ℎ,𝑖which minimises the loss.
(ii) Allocate a weight of 𝑣−1

to the minimiser.
(b) Collect the weight 𝛿𝑡and align the forecast vector ^𝑦𝑀
𝑡+𝑘|𝑡
(c) Obtain and store ^𝑦𝑡+𝑘|𝑡(ℎ𝐴𝐸
𝑡
) = ⟨𝛿𝑡, ^𝑦𝑀
𝑡+𝑘|𝑡⟩as the forecast
evaluation on past forecasts. To do this, we evaluate the loss of each
model over a recent tranche of data. Consider a 𝑣-sized window up
to time 𝑡, {𝑦𝜏}𝑡
𝜏=𝑡−𝑣+1, and a given pair (ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖). We have access
to ^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−˜𝑘(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖) for all 𝜏∈{𝑡−𝑣−𝑘+ 1, ...,𝑡−1,𝑡} and ˜𝑘∈[𝑘].
Now, define a formulation of ℓas below:
ℓsingle-valued(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖; 𝜆, 𝑝) :=
𝑡∑︁
𝜏=𝑡−𝑣+1
𝜆𝑡−𝜏|^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−𝑘−𝑦𝜏|𝑝
(1)
Equation 1 specifies a global loss function by summing over the
local loss functions in a window 𝑣. The associated hyperparameters
are 𝜆∈(0, 1] and 𝑝∈(0, ∞). The larger the 𝜆, the more focused the
loss is towards the recent history, and vice versa. While 𝑣is clearly
a hyperparameter as well, it is not being investigated in this paper,
as 𝜆𝑡−𝜏discounts the history in a way that controls the effective
contribution of the far history to the loss. For general intuition, take
𝜆= 1 and 𝑝∈{1, 2}, then Equation 1 is simply an MAE or MSE
over the period.
We next consider a loss function that is more suited to models
with a longer forecast horizon, shown in Equation 2, where 1𝑘:=
(1, 1, ..., 1, 1) ∈R𝑘and ^𝒚𝜏+𝑘|𝜏:= (^𝑦𝜏+𝑘|𝜏+𝑘−1, ^𝑦𝜏+𝑘|𝜏+𝑘−2, ..., ^𝑦𝜏+𝑘|𝜏) ∈
R𝑘.
ℓmulti-valued(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖; 𝜆, 𝑝) :=
𝑡∑︁
𝜏=𝑡−𝑣+1
𝜆𝑡−𝜏||^𝒚𝜏|𝜏−𝑘−𝑦𝜏1𝑘||𝑝
𝑝
(2)
The novelty behind Equation 2 is as follows. For 𝑘≥2, the term that
differs from Equation 1 is ^𝒚𝜏|𝜏−𝑘−𝑦𝜏1𝑘. This is a vector containing
information in a higher dimension than just the scalar ^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−𝑘−𝑦𝜏.
For instance, the loss within Equation 2 contains ^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−1 −𝑦𝜏due to
the vector form and the norm taken — this is not part of Equation 1.
We note that ^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−1 uses information up to 𝜏−1, which is more
recent than the one used by ^𝑦𝜏|𝜏−𝑘, hence facing less noise and
more contemporary information on the performance of model and
estimation techniques.
Following the above configuration of the loss function, we find
the pair which minimises the loss:
(ℎ∗, Ξ∗
ℎ,𝑖) :=
arg min
(ℎ,Ξℎ,𝑖) ∈∪{(ℎ,Ξℎ,𝑖):𝑖∈𝐼(ℎ),ℎ∈𝐻}
ℓ(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖)
(3)
DMS then adapts to the selected model for forecasting: ^𝑦𝑡+𝑘|𝑡(ℎ𝐷𝑀𝑆
𝑡
) =
^𝑦𝑡+𝑘|𝑡(ℎ∗, Ξ∗
ℎ,𝑖). For a general algorithm for computing implemen-
tation, see algorithm 1.
2.2
Adaptive Ensemble
We next introduce the case of ensembling models according to their
loss over a recent window of data. We call this Adaptive Ensemble
(AE). The ensembling weight takes the form of a convex combina-
tion from 𝐻, in particular, the weight lies in a simplex 𝐻𝐴𝐸= Δ(𝑀)
where 𝑀:= | ∪{(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖) : 𝑖∈𝐼(ℎ),ℎ∈𝐻}|, which is the total
number of estimation techniques across all models. (There are vari-
ous ways for ensembling models, some more closely related to time
series, such as the Particle filters methods [6]. Here, we propose
to form the weights in an additive sub-sampling scheme without
Bayesian inference.)
Algorithmically, we first enumerate the set ∪{(ℎ, Ξℎ,𝑖) : 𝑖∈
𝐼(ℎ),ℎ∈𝐻} into [𝑀] and align the associated forecasts to a M
dimensional vector ^𝑦𝑀
𝑡+𝑘|𝑡. For an element called ensemble weight
𝛿𝑡∈Δ(𝑀), the AE adapts to the selected weight by the inner prod-
uct: ^𝑦𝑡+𝑘|𝑡(ℎ𝐴𝐸) = ⟨𝛿𝑡, ^𝑦𝑁
𝑡+𝑘|𝑡⟩. It remains to introduce the method
of determining the weight: we subsample the data points in the
window 𝑣as follows. Consider a smaller window 𝑣0, and for each
time 𝜏∈{𝑡−𝑣0 + 1, ...,𝑡−1,𝑡}, look back a window of 𝑣1, where
𝑣1 = 𝑣−𝑣0. Find the best model in the 𝑣1 window up to each time
𝜏. That is, for each 𝜏, we proceed with the optimisation as per Equa-
tion 3. Allocate an equal weight of 𝑣−1
0
to the model selected. This
then produces 𝛿𝑡∈Δ(𝑀) as desired. See algorithm 2 for a general
algorithm.

evaluating forecasts in the context of financial time series. Here,
we consider the following financial evaluation metrics from an
induced trading strategy. These metrics form the backbone of the
DAA method we propose in section 2.4.
Denote {1, 2, ...,𝑇} as the index of testing data, and as the fre-
quency of data is daily, each index corresponds to one trading day.
Recall 𝑘is fixed as a forecast horizon. Let ^𝑦𝐴
𝜏|𝜏−𝑘be the 𝑘-step ahead
forecast made on the return of asset 𝐴at time 𝜏−𝑘. At time 𝑡, we

It is important to observe Equation 4 as an effective restriction to
long-only holdings. Alternative trading strategies use long-short
signals, which implies solely trading on the direction of the model’s
prediction. This is a limitation of the current study, since the 1
2
harmonises the performance by endowing us with a base case of
half of the baseline. However, it also eases the debate towards costs
of shorting, as shorting an asset may not be always feasible and
can be costly, especially for VIX. Certainly, the notion of ‘short
the market’ may be achieved by long VIX, and we investigate this
further in the form of cross asset strategy in section 4.
Let 𝑃𝐴
𝑡be the price of asset 𝐴at time 𝑡. Consider the notion of

2.4
Dynamic Asset Allocation
In time series, we test the predictive models via a ‘dynamic evalua-
tion’ regime, wherein some previous batches of observations would
be used for finding the top performers, followed by the next batch
of observations for testing. Now, in the context of financial time se-
ries, such an evaluation can be attributed to financial metrics rather
than MSE. In what follows, we present an algorithm for using SR
Fig. 2. DAA as a rolling process for validation and testing
to decide, on a quarterly basis, what hyperparameter (this includes
different algorithms, loss functions, forecast horizons, and assets) to
choose. This algorithm is also a step towards an automated portfolio
manager, which aims to achieve outperforming financial results
while satisfying investment constraints.
To introduce the notation, let {1, 2, ..., 𝐾} be the forecast horizons
produced, and let A be the set of all assets. The aim is then to
produce an averaged holding of 𝑁:= 𝐾× |A| strategies, from the
strategies induced by a collection of models, noted 𝐻𝐴for asset 𝐴∈
A. (As a note to avoid confusion: the set 𝐻𝐴includes all strategies
associated with all hyperparameters and all forecast horizons for
asset 𝐴.) Now, consider quarter-evaluation dates {𝑞𝑗}𝐽
𝑗=1, then for
each strategy and asset, we are able to access its historical SR (here,
we set this as the recent 252 days, corresponding to one trading
year), noted 𝑆𝑘,𝐴
𝑗
(ℎ).
The last input to consider is whether a choice of cap is employed
— this is entirely user-dependent as this relates to the demand from
the end-user, in the financial context, the portfolio manager or
investor. Choosing the strategy to be capped would mean that the
portfolio would be restricted to a certain percentage for each asset’s
exposure (here, we assume an equal-cap is enforced, so having a
capped strategy implies capping the maximum holding of every
asset to a weight of |A|−1), else we consider the strategy to be

uncapped, where no bounds on the exposure of a certain asset would
be enforced. Both strategies have merits and supporting intuitions,
being more generally known as dynamically weighted or equally
weighted strategies in portfolio finance. As a remark on the case of
a single asset, i.e. |A| = 1: the DAA, no matter capped or uncapped,
reduces to a simpler decision amongst models and forecast horizons.
The full algorithm is provided in algorithm 3 and a graphical illus-
tration of the process is provided in Figure 2. Notice that the use of
SR has a significant advantage compared to MSE in terms of variable
selection: that not only could comparison be made across models,
but also across different forecasting variables. This is otherwise not
achievable. In essence, at time 𝑡, if we forecast 𝑌at time 𝑡+ 𝑘, the
distribution of such variable could be quite different from the distri-
bution of another variable 𝑍at time 𝑡+𝑘. Now, the use of Equation 4
and associated Sharpe Ratio moderates the values of forecasts, and
finally enables a more robust evaluation for model performance,
across different variables (𝐴∈A) and forecast horizons (𝑘∈[𝐾]).

FINANCIAL RESULTS
3.1
Data, Models, and Implementations
For the empirical investigation, we use the following data, all on a
daily basis:
• Assets: SP500 index, CBOE VIX index, NASDAQ100 index (NAS100),
and DJIA30 index. These are obtained as daily close levels from
Yahoo Finance.
• Yield Curve (US treasury rates): constant maturity of 1, 3, 6, 12,
24, 36, 60, 84, 120, 240, and 360 months. These are obtained from
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ online database.
• VIX Curve: VIX Index and 1 to 7 months of maturity futures of
VIX contracts are obtained as daily close levels from CBOE.
The full sample ranges from the start of year 2013 to the end of year
2021.
As a data processing technique commonly used in the relevant
empirical literature, we consider the logged difference of asset price
to be return, that is, for a given asset 𝐴, the 𝑘-days ahead return is
defined as
𝑟𝐴
𝑡:(𝑡+𝑘) := log(𝑝𝐴
𝑡+𝑘) −log(𝑝𝐴
𝑡)
where 𝑝𝐴
𝑡denotes the price of asset 𝐴at time 𝑡. In the models, we
use the notation𝑦𝑡to represent 𝑟𝐴
(𝑡−𝑘):𝑡. As for yield and VIX curves,
we consider the ‘slopes’, noted 𝑠𝑡at time 𝑡, to be estimated by
𝑝𝑡,𝑗= 𝛼𝑡+ 𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑡,𝑗+ 𝜀𝑡,𝑗, 𝜀𝑡,𝑗∼𝑁(0, 𝜎2
𝑗) ∀𝑗∈[𝐽],𝑡
where 𝑝𝑡,𝑗indicates the price of the future (or interest rate) with
maturity 𝑚𝑡,𝑗. For VIX, 𝐽= 8 and for Yield Curve, 𝐽= 11. This is a
common method of estimating the slope of a term structure, as is
pointed out in section 1.1. To populate meaningful models into the
model space 𝐻, we consider the following three classes using the
data we have:
• Class 1: AR(p) models on returns 𝑦𝑡= 𝛼+Í𝑝
𝑗=1 𝜙𝑗𝑦𝑡−𝑗+𝜀𝑡where
𝑝∈{0, 1, ..., 5}. Note 𝐴𝑅(0) is a constant model.
• Class 2: lagged linear regression with slope or spread from Yield
or VIX curves 𝑦𝑡= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑠𝑡−𝑘+ 𝜀𝑡
• Class 3: lagged linear regression with a pair of short-long rates
𝑦𝑡= 𝛼+ 𝛽1short𝑡−𝑘+ 𝛽2long𝑡−𝑘+ 𝜀𝑡where short and long refer
to short-term and long-term rates: in VIX, short-term refers to
maturities up to and including 3 months, with the rest being long-
term; and in Yield Curve, short-term refers to maturities up to
and including 24 months, with the rest being long-term.
All models are equipped with 5 different window sizes for esti-
mation: 22, 44, 63, 126, and 252, representing a look-back win-
dow of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months respectively. Estimation meth-
ods for AR models (those in Class 1) are via Yule Walker, and
for explanatory models (those in Class 2 and 3) are via OLS. For
DMS and AE implementation, hyperparameters are taken as fol-
lows: 𝐾= 5, 𝑣0 = 𝑣1 = 50, 𝑣= 100 for choices of maximum
forecast steps and window sizes respectively, and 𝑝∈{1, 1.5, 2},
𝜆∈{0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99, 1} for configurations
of the loss functions.
3.2
Overall Evaluation
As an overall evaluation, we implement trading strategies induced
by both AE/DMS and fixed models. We consider trading all four
market indices: SP500, VIX, NAS100, and DJIA30. We use the first
full year of validation data from Q3 2014, to select the optimal
hyperparameters and model specifications. In Figure 3, we provide
the cumulative profit associated with both strategies over the testing
period, spanning from the start of Q4 2015 to the end of 2021. As a
comparison, we also provide a benchmark that holds a constant of
0.5 and weights equally between the four indices. These results are
presented in both individual returns (lower) and averaged (upper).
The AE/DMS induced forecasts strongly outperform the ones by
fixed models, in terms of cumulative profit in the testing period,
being up 60% where the fixed models are approximately break-even.
The AE/DMS also outperforms the equally-weighted benchmark,
albeit having a more tumultuous rise. This can also be observed
in Table 1, where AE/DMS outperforms in terms of ANR and SR,
but underperforms the benchmark in terms of MDD. By observing
the performance of individual asset’s results, we see the AE/DMS
outperforms the fixed models in 3 out of the 4 assets, while outper-
forming the benchmark in all four cases.

Towards an Automated Portfolio Manager: Dynamic
Asset Allocation
We proceed to present the results obtained by selecting different
learning-induced strategies over time, as was prescribed in section
2.4. Here, we focus on the three equity indices, and return to discuss
how VIX can be used within in a dynamic hedging framework in
section 4. As part of the DAA setup, we consider both a capped and
an uncapped regime (as detailed in section 2.4, the capped regime
implies that each index weighting cannot exceed a certain threshold,
while uncapped does not impose this restriction). We also include a
benchmark, which uses an equal weight in the three equity indices.
The financial results are presented in the upper panel of Figure 4.
It is clear that all three strategies perform similarly until 2020, at

and Benchmark under trading schemes that consider four indices (upper)
and each asset separately (lower)
which point the uncapped DAA outperforms the benchmark in
terms of cumulative profit, while the capped DAA underperforms.
This may be traced to the weights of the uncapped allocation, shown
in the lower panel of Figure 4. In particular, the uncapped allocation
keeps a high weighting in the NAS100 during and after the 2020
market crash. Ultimately, the uncapped allocation shows a stronger
recovery and greater cumulative profit than both the capped alloca-
tion and the benchmark, owing to the strong performance of the
underlying NAS100 index.
The summarised statistics are presented in Table 2: both the un-
capped and capped allocations obtain a lower Sharpe ratio and MDD
than the equally-weighted benchmark. Hence, while varying the
weight on each asset (the uncapped DAA does this significantly as
per the lower panel of Figure 4) may be more profitable than weight-
ing equally, it does not appear to improve risk-adjusted return or
other downside metrics as a whole. This corroborates standard diver-
sification arguments, wherein increasing the number of securities
reduces the variance of the portfolio. In Table 2, this is presented by
a higher ANR and lower MDD, compared to the others.

EXTENSION TO CROSS-ASSET STRATEGY
A passive hedge, such as a fixed portion of the VIX, inherently
lowers the return of a portfolio. This can be observed in Figure 3,
where a constant 1/4 holding of VIX causes the benchmark to un-
derperform in terms of ANR and SR. At the same time, hedging
serves an important purpose in limiting an investor’s downside.

Indeed, Table 1 also shows that an investor would face a drawdown
of at most 10.20% over the lifetime of this portfolio. This apparent
trade-off is consistent with the general conception of hedging in
a passive context: during a market upturn, a hedge can cause a
so-called ’return-drag’, while in a down-market it can directly offset
losses.
This begs the question as to whether we can construct a dynamic
hedging strategy to avoid return drag while maintaining downside
protection. To this end, we consider a set of cross-asset strategies
(CAS) for an investor hedging SP500 or NAS100 using the VIX. We

proceed with the introduction of the case of SP500, while the case
of NAS100 is exactly the same in methodology.
Here, we hold the SP500 as normal, longing an extra 1

However, when we predict a rise in the SP500, we also long the
VIX as a method of hedging our added exposure, as per Equation 6.
The extent to which we hedge is itself a parameter, 𝑘∗, which takes
either 3𝑘or 6𝑘depending on an investor’s risk tolerance. 3𝑘implies
hedging the entire portfolio, fitting for a risk-averse investor, while
6𝑘hedges just the speculative long.
In addition to the desired strategies and long-only benchmark,
we also add a benchmark which, on top of holding a constant of 1
2
of the asset, holds an additional 1
6 of VIX. We call this the ‘always
hedged’ case.
The cumulative return are plotted in Figure 5 for both assets.
Detailed performance metrics are presented in Table 3. CAS achieves
a reduction in MDD while still maintaining a strong ANR and SR.
The CAS using 𝑘∗= 6𝑘in NAS100 outperforms the benchmark
on every metric, striking the desired balance between return and
downside protection. Clearly, using DAA to dynamically hedge
the exposure gives an improvement of risk-adjusted return to the
portfolio: CAS tactically holds VIX and maintain a competent risk
exposure (as demonstrated by Figure 5 and MDD in Table 3) while
achieving higher return (ANR as high as 21% could be achieved),
hence the high SR at the end, with the NAS100 case achieving a SR
of 1.303.

CASE STUDY & INTERPRETATION: 2020 MARKET
CRASH
In this section, we demonstrate the usage of the algorithms to inter-
pret historical events. The 2020 market crash induced huge volatility
and contaminated data, which makes itself as a challenging interpre-
tation task. In forecasting analytics, we select the hyperparameter
ex-post as we aim for analysing the composition of the forecasts
from DMS and AE, whereas in the financial performance part, we
select hyperparameter ex-ante using the automated DAA decision
(because DAA is using pre-Q1 2020 information for Q1 2020 and
pre-Q2 2020 information for Q2 2020).
5.1
Forecasting Analytics
We draw attention to Figure 6. On the left, we follow the develop-
ment of NAS100 stock returns with 𝑘= 2, in which the market
crashed and re-bounded in March 2020. The model shown here is a
DMS model with 𝑝= 0.85, 𝜆= 1.5 and multi-valued norm. On the
right, we follow the returns of the VIX index, also with 𝑘= 3. For
this, the model is an AE model with 𝑝= 1, 𝜆= 1 and single-valued
norm (this is exactly the formulation of a rolling MAE). On the
lower panels, we show the specifications of the underlying chosen
model(s). For NAS100, DMS has a preference for model group 3
during the height of the crash. Similarly for VIX, the AE model

𝑘= 2 and DMS, right: VIX with 𝑘= 3 and AE). The top row reports the
actual returns (blue) versus forecasts (red), the second row reports the
induced cumulative profit (red) versus long only (blue), the third row reports
the choice of window size (DMS) or weights on the window size (AE), the
fourth row reports the choice (DMS) or weights (AE) on model group, and
the fifth row reports the induced holding weights from the strategies
maintains a high weight in model group 3 during this period. Both
models favour incorporating explanatory variables from the VIX and
Yield curves during this period, which aligns with the perception of
the curves as leading market timing indicators.
For window size, the smallest window (𝑤= 22) is chosen con-
sistently by the DMS model throughout the most volatile period.
This supports the argument that, during a major regime switch,
data far in the past can be less relevant to the current evaluation.
Hence models incorporating small samples of contemporary data
can perform better than those considering large but contaminated
samples. When the series stabilises, larger windows (𝑤= 126 or 252)
are preferred. Here, larger window sizes ensure greater stability in
parameter estimation, since the time series at this point is broadly
reflective of the history. This underscores the problem with standard
cross validation when being applied to financial time series, as it
assumes that the time series distribution would remain unchanged
between periods. DMS gets around this problem by providing time-
varying cross validation. This allows DMS, for instance, to have a
general preference for large window sizes but also to select models
with smaller window sizes when larger ones are contaminated.
5.2
Financial Performance of Cross Asset Strategies
For financial performance of DAA, we zoom in the results we had
on CAS in section 4. As plotted in Figure 7, a high return can be
observed in the strategies, while the drawdown is maintained to be
more robust as its consistent VIX holdings (shown at the bottom)
serve as a good hedge. This, together with section 4, proves the

empirical value of our methods, that they outperform the market in
both risks and return, even at the market crash.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA
We have proposed a generalised framework and algorithms for time
series model selection, ensemble, and financial evaluation. The DMS
and AE methods require a specification of a model set in terms of
functional forms and training methods for parametric estimation
and forecasting. Once equipped, they provide time-varying selection
and leverage higher-order time series information than typical cross-
validation procedures.
While various forms of loss functions and hyperparameters were
studied in this paper, the algorithm leaves many choices open. The
local loss function, for instance, could inherit from robust statistics
such as Huber loss; and the global loss could include further tech-
niques of change point detections [1, 10]. Alternative specifications
of hyperparameters (𝑝and 𝜆) may also further improve the sample
evaluation, as was encouraged by [11–13].
Further, we present DAA, which can automatically select from
competing strategies. This framework has an edge against typical
evaluation metrics, such as MSE, which are incomparable for differ-
ent choices of the forecasting target. We show that the framework is
a step towards an automated portfolio manager, since it can achieve
strong returns while obeying typical investment constraints and
being interpretable by the end-user. In addition, we extend DAA
to cross-asset strategies, where we dynamically hedge against or-
dinary strategies using VIX. These obtain outstanding financial
performance.
We notice that the trading of VIX could be ambiguous: it is more
common to trade the close-to-expiration VIX contracts instead of
the index, as the latter incurs continuous adjustment costs due to
its original formulation [22]. A future agenda would be to use these
algorithms and seek optimal financial decisions such as the roll-over
of contracts.
Lastly, interpretability behind the algorithms can be achieved,
as the components of the forecasts can always be retrieved and
such statistics can be used for empirical investigations and under-
standings of the algorithm. We have demonstrated an example by
interpreting the model choices during the 2020 market crash, along-
side the robust financial results.
From a basic set of parametric models and forecasts, DMS and AE
respectively enable model selection and combination over time. DAA
further selects the hyperparameters and makes decisions across
assets and forecasting horizons of all the models. These all-in-three
algorithms enable further extension towards automation in financial
time series and machine learning.
