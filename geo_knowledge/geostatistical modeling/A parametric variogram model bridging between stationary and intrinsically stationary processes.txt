Abstract: A simple variogram model with two parameters is presented that includes the power var-
iogram for the fractional Brownian motion, a modiﬁed De Wijsian model, the generalized Cauchy
model and the multiquadrics model. One parameter controls the smoothness of the process. The
other parameter allows for a smooth parametrization between stationary and intrinsically station-
ary second order processes in a Gaussian framework, or between mixing and non-ergodic max-stable
processes when modeling spatial extremes by a Brown-Resnick process.

Introduction
A Gaussian random ﬁeld Z is a popular process to model spatial data in Rd, mostly assuming
some kind of at least underlying stationarity and isotropy of the ﬁeld. A weakly stationary random
ﬁeld can be characterized by a bounded variogram γ, where γ(h) = 1
2E{Z(h) −Z(0)}2, h ∈Rd
(Gneiting and Guttorp, 2010). In contrast, the variogram of an intrinsically stationary random
ﬁeld might be unbounded. Although any unbounded variogram can be approximated arbitrarily
closely on any compact set by a bounded variogram (Schlather and Gneiting, 2006), models that
bridge between bounded and unbounded models seem to be used only rarely in statistics if at all,
as appealing models are missing.
The Brown-Resnick process on Rd (Brown and Resnick, 1977; Kabluchko et al., 2009) is a max-
stable random ﬁeld that is based on intrinsically stationary Gaussian random ﬁelds and is used to
model spatial extreme values, such as heavy rainfall (Fawcett and Walshaw, 2014; Thibaud et al.,
2013), avalanches (Blanchet and Davison, 2011), extreme temperature (Davison et al., 2013) or
extreme wind (Zhang et al., 2014). If the underlying variogram model is bounded, then the corre-
sponding Brown-Resnick ﬁeld is not ergodic whilst a one-dimensional process has been shown to
be mixing when the variogram model γ(h), h ∈R, grows faster that 4 log |h| (Wang and Stoev,
2010; Kabluchko and Schlather, 2010). Ergodicity might be assumed if the extremes are caused by
local events, e.g., storm events, while non-ergodic models are suitable for spatially extended events
such as cyclonic rainfall. When the kind of causative process for spatial extremes is not clear, a
parametric model that allows for both ergodic and non-ergodic ﬁelds is advantageous.
For lack of awareness of suitable parametric models that bridge between stationary and intrinsically
stationary Gaussian random ﬁelds, studies in both traditional geostatistics and spatial extreme
value analysis using the Brown-Resnick model include two classes of models to cover the cases of
bounded and unbounded variograms models, cf. Thibaud et al. (2013) or Wadsworth and Tawn
(2014), for instance.

Here, we present an easily accessible, rotation invariant variogram model with two parameters
that bridges between the class of bounded variograms and the class of unbounded ones. It includes
several well-known models, but contains also novel parameter combinations. Hence, the model
might be particularly useful in any application of spatial statistics.

The model
For 0 < α ≤2 and −∞< β ≤2 let the function γα,β : Rd →[0, ∞) be deﬁned as
γα,β(h) = (1 + ∥h∥α)β/α −1
2β/α −1
,
where the limiting function is log(1 + ∥h∥α)/log 2 as β →0.
Proposition 1 The function γα,β is a variogram in Rd for any d ∈N, 0 < α ≤2 and −∞< β ≤2.
Proof. A positive constant and the identity being complete Bernstein functions, Corollary 7.12
and Proposition 7.10 in Schilling et al. (2010) yield that f(λ) = (1 + λδ)ε/δ is a Bernstein function
for any 0 < ε ≤1 and 0 < |δ| ≤1. Now f(g) is a negative deﬁnite function for any negative deﬁnite
function g and any Bernstein function f (Schilling et al., 2010, Chapter 4). Choosing g(h) = ∥h∥2,
ε = β/2 and δ = α/2, we get the assertion for positive values of β. For negative values of β we
refer to the fact that (1 + γ)β is a positive deﬁnite function for any variogram γ, see (Schlather,
2012, p. 36), for instance. By the basic properties of negative deﬁnite functions the limiting cases
obtained by point-wise convergence are included.
The parameter α models the smoothness of both the variogram and the corresponding (Gaussian)
random ﬁeld (Adler, 1981; Scheuerer, 2010) whereas β indicates the long range behavior (Gneiting,
2000). For negative values of β the model is bounded and heavy tailed, whereas for 0 ≤β ≤2 the
variogram γα,β is unbounded. The normalizing factor is chosen such that γα,β(1) = 1.
The model simpliﬁes for β = α to the power model of a fractional Brownian random ﬁeld
(Chil`es and Delﬁner, 1999), for 0 < β ≤α to a generalization of the fractional Brownian model
described in Gneiting (2002) and Schlather (2010), and for β < 0 to the generalized Cauchy model
(Gneiting, 2000). It also generalizes partially the multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics used in
approximation theory where α = 2 and β/α ∈R\N0, see, for instance, Buhmann (1990), Wendland
(2005) or Lin and Yuan (2006). As β →0, the limiting model equals a modiﬁed version of the De
Wijsian model (Wackernagel, 2003; Matheron, 1962). The case 0 < α < β ≤2 is novel.
The presented variogram model can be generalized. Indeed, the proof of the proposition shows
that γδ,g = {(1 + g)δ −1}/(2δ −1) is a variogram in Rd for any variogram g and −∞< δ ≤1 with
limiting case γ0,g = log(1 + g)/ log(2).
