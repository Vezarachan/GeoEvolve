We evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the DAMA/LIBRA claims for annual modulation using
three independent model comparison techniques, viz frequentist, information theory, and Bayesian
analysis. We ﬁt the data from the DAMA/LIBRA experiment to both cosine and a constant model,
and carry out model comparison by choosing the constant model as the null hypothesis. For the
frequentist test, we invoke Wilk’s theorem and calculate the signiﬁcance using ∆χ2 between the two
models. For information theoretical tests, we calculate the diﬀerence in Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and Bayesian Information criterion (BIC) between the two models. We also compare the two
models in a Bayesian context by calculating the Bayes factor. We also search for higher harmonics in
the DAMA/LIBRA data using generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We ﬁnally test the sensitivity
of these model comparison techniques in discriminating between pure noise and a cosine signal using
synthetic data. This is the ﬁrst proof of principles application of AIC, BIC as well as Bayes factor
to the DAMA data. All our analysis codes along with the data used in this work have been made
publicly available.

INTRODUCTION
The dark matter problem [1, 2] is one of the most im-
portant vexing problems in astrophysics eluding a solu-
tion, ever since its existence was ﬁrst pointed out 80-90
years ago by Oort and Zwicky [3]. The current concor-
dance model of cosmology indicates that about 27% of
universe contains cold dark matter [4]. It has been known
since the 1970s that any elementary particle, which is a
thermal relic from the Big-Bang and with electroweak
scale interactions with ordinary matter satisﬁes all the
properties needed for a cold dark matter candidate, such
as the correct relic abundance, non-relativistic velocities
at the time of decoupling, etc [5]. Therefore, such weakly
interacting massive particles (hereafter, WIMPs) are the
most favored dark matter candidates.
A whole slew of experiments and detection methods
have been employed to experimentally detect WIMPs
and measure its properties [6]. These include direct pro-
duction of WIMPs at collider experiments, indirect sig-
natures of WIMP annihilation products in cosmic rays,
neutrinos, or photons, and direct detection of dark mat-
ter in underground cryogenic experiments. At the time
of writing, there is no incontrovertible evidence for any
smoking-gun signatures of WIMP annihilation or direct
production of WIMPs (see Refs. [7–11] and references
therein for most recent updates.)
Among the plethora of direct dark matter detection
experiments, only one experiment (viz. the DAMA ex-
periment in Gran Sasso) has argued for the detection of

dark matter. The observational signature found by the
DAMA collaboration indicative of dark matter, is the
detection of annual modulation in their residual count
rates, which is based on the vector sum of the motion
of our Sun moving in our galaxy with respect to the Lo-
cal Standard of Rest and the Earth’s revolution around
the Sun. It was pointed out in the 1980s [12, 13], that
because of these motions, any dark matter experiment
should detect a peak ﬂux of WIMP-induced interactions
around June 2 (when Earth’s orbital velocity gets added
to that of the Sun with respect to the Galaxy) and a min-
imum around December 2 (when Earth’s orbital velocity
gets subtracted compared to that of the Sun). For more
than 20 years, DAMA experiment has found such an an-
nual modulation in their residual count rates, which has
exactly the above signatures. The ﬁrst phase of DAMA
started in 1995.
At the time of the ﬁrst data release,
the evidence was 3σ [14]. The statistical signiﬁcance of
this annual modulation has steadily increased with ac-
cumulated data taking, during the diﬀerent phases of
the DAMA experiment [15–19]. At the end of the ﬁrst
phase of the DAMA experiment (called DAMA/NaI),
the statistical signiﬁcance had increased to 6.3σ [15].
In the latest data release from phase 2 of the upgraded
DAMA/LIBRA experiment (where the energy threshold
has been lowered), the net statistical signiﬁcance in the
2-6 keV energy bin, after combining data from all the
phases of the experiment is 12.9σ and greater than 8σ in
other energy intervals [19].
One problem with the dark matter interpretation of the
above claim is that this signal has not been conﬁrmed by
any other direct detection experiment, and the entire al-
lowed region enclosing the WIMP mass and cross-section
(inferred from the DAMA annual modulation), has been
ruled out by a number of other direct dark matter detec-
tion experiments [20–23]. See for example Ref. [24, 25]

for a recent review of all direct dark matter searches.
Although a number of particle physics, nuclear physics,
and astrophysics explanations have been concocted to
reconcile the incompatibility of DAMA results with other
experiments (eg. [26–31] and references therein), none of
them can satisfactorily explain all the DAMA observa-
tions. However, until recently, none of the other direct
detection dark matter experiments had used the same
target as DAMA (NaI) or were sensitive to the same
annual modulation signature found in DAMA; but this
has been recently rectiﬁed.
In 2019, two experiments
ANAIS-112 and COSINE-100, both of which use NaI(Tl)
as the detector target released their ﬁrst results.
The
ANAIS-112 experiment located in the Canfranc Under-
ground Laboratory in Spain released results from modu-
lation analysis of 1.5 years of data from 157.55 kg years
exposure [32]. The COSINE-100 experiment [33] located
in the Yangyang underground laboratory in South Korea
released their ﬁrst results using 1.7 years of data with a
total exposure of 97.7 kg years. The current exposures of
these experiments is not large enough to robustly rule out
the DAMA claim. This annual modulation claim will also
be tested by other experiments, such as DM-Ice17 [34],
KIMS [35], and SABRE [36].
The DAMA collaboration has calculated the statisti-
cal signiﬁcance of the annual modulation claim using the
frequentist test, by comparing the diﬀerence in χ2 be-
tween the null hypothesis and the sinusoidal model [19].
Although a few other groups have done an independent
statistical analysis of the DAMA data [37–40], a model
comparison analysis of the DAMA annual modulation
claims using Bayesian or information theory methods has
not been previously done. It is important to test the ro-
bustness of the claim using independent model compar-
ison techniques. Such model comparison techniques are
now routinely used in Cosmology to weigh the evidence
for ΛCDM model versus alternatives [41–45]. Previously
in this ﬁeld, Bayesian techniques have been used to test
if the CoGeNT annual modulation data can be explained
by dark matter induced scatterings [46]. They have also
been used to test the compatibility of upper limit on
WIMP couplings from XENON-100 experiment, with the
annual modulation seen in DAMA and CoGeNT [47] (see
also Ref. [48]). This is the main goal of this work. The
techniques used in this work can be easily applied to eval-
uate the signiﬁcance of annual modulation claims of other
experiments, some of which have already produced pre-
liminary results.
The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sect. II, we
provide an abridged summary of model comparison tech-
niques. The summary of DAMA results in their latest
data release paper can be found in Sect. III. Our analy-
sis and results are described in Sect. IV. Our results of
searches for higher harmonics are described in Sect. V.
We also carry out sensitivity analysis of a dark matter
experiment with similar backgrounds as ANAIS-112 or
COSINE-100 in conﬁrming the DAMA annual modula-
tion signal in Sect. VI. We conclude in Sect. VII. Our
analysis codes have been made publicly available and the
github link for the same is provided in Sect. VII.

INTRODUCTION TO MODEL
COMPARISON TECHNIQUES
In recent years a large number of both Bayesian, fre-
quentist, and information theory based model compar-
ison techniques (originally developed by the statistics
community) have been applied to a variety of problems in
astrophysics and cosmology involving hypothesis testing
or comparing which of two models is favored and quanti-
fying its statistical signiﬁcance. For our purpose, we shall
employ all the available techniques at our disposal to ad-
dress the signiﬁcance of the DAMA annual modulation
claim. We brieﬂy recap these techniques below. More
details on each of these tests can be found in various re-
views [41, 42, 45, 49], and proof of principles applications
of some of these techniques to problems in astrophysics
and cosmology can be found in Refs. [43, 50–55].
• Frequentist Test: This method for model com-
parison is sometimes also known as the Likelihood
ratio test [45]. The ﬁrst step in this, involves pa-
rameter estimation for a given hypothesis, usually
by minimizing the χ2 functional between the data
and model.
Then, based on the best-ﬁt χ2 be-
tween a given model and data and from the de-
grees of freedom, one calculates the goodness of ﬁt
for each model, given by the χ2 probability distri-
bution function [56]. This allows one to penalize
models with complexity.
The best-ﬁt model between the two is the one with
the larger value of χ2 goodness of ﬁt. If the two
models are nested, then from Wilk’s theorem [57],
the diﬀerence in χ2 between the two models satisﬁes
a χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to
the diﬀerence in the number of free parameters for
the two hypotheses [45, 49]. Therefore, the χ2 c.d.f.
can be used to quantify the p-value of a given hy-
pothesis. From the p-value, one usually calculates
a Z-score or number of sigmas, which is the num-
ber of standard deviations that a Gaussian variable
would ﬂuctuate in one direction to give the corre-
sponding p-value [54, 58]. This test has been used
for a variety of applications in astrophysics and cos-
mology [50, 52, 54, 59]. We note that the DAMA
collaboration also uses this test in their data re-
lease papers to assess the signiﬁcance of their an-
nual modulation claim.
• Akaike Information Criterion:
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used
to penalize for any free parameters to avoid over-
ﬁtting.
AIC is an approximate minimization of
Kullback-Leibler information entropy, which esti-
mates the distance between two probability distri-

3
butions [42] and is given by:
AIC = −2 ln Lmax + 2p,
(1)
where p is the number of free parameters, and L is
the likelihood. A preferred model in this test is the
one with the smaller value of AIC between the two
hypothesis. There is no formal method to evaluate
the p-value from the diﬀerence in AIC between the
two models 1, and usually qualitative strength of
evidence rules are used [43] to estimate the relative
signiﬁcance of the favored model.
• Bayesian Information Criterion: The Bayesian
Inference Criterion (BIC) is also used for penalizing
the use of extra parameters and is an approxima-
tion to the Bayes factor. It is given by [41]:
BIC = −2 ln Lmax + p ln N,
(2)
where all the parameters have the same interpreta-
tion as in Eq. 1. Similar to AIC, the model with the
smaller value of BIC is the preferred model. The
signiﬁcance is estimated qualitatively in the same
way as for AIC.
Besides AIC and BIC, other information criterion
based tests such as Takeuchi information criterion
and Deviance information criterion [42] have also
been proposed. But their computation as well as
interpretation is not straightforward, and hence we
do not implement them in this work.
• Bayesian Model Selection: Apart from the in-
formation theory-based techniques such as AIC and
BIC, Bayesian model comparison techniques [44]
have also been extensively used for model compar-
ison in astrophysics and cosmology [44, 50, 51, 60].
The key quantity, which needs to be computed to
compare two models (M1 and M2) is the Bayesian
odds ratio, given by:
O21 = P(M2|D)
P(M1|D),
(3)
where P(M2|D) is the posterior probability for M2
given data D, and similarly for P(M1|D). The pos-
terior probability for a general model M is given by
P(M|D) = P(D|M)P(M)
P(D)
,
(4)
where P(M) is the prior probability for the model
M, P(D) is the probability for the data D and
P(D|M) is the marginal likelihood or Bayesian ev-
idence for model M and it quantiﬁes the probability
1 See however Ref. [50], which posits a signiﬁcance based on
exp(−∆AIC/2)
that the data D would be observed if the model M
were the correct model. P(D|M) is given by:
P(D|M) =
Z
P(D|M, θ)P(θ|M)dθ,
(5)
where
θ
is
a
vector
of
parameters,
which
parametrizes the model M. If the prior probabili-
ties of the two models are equal, the odds ratio can
be written as:
B21 =
R
P(D|M2, θ2)P(θ2)dθ2
R
P(D|M1, θ1)P(θ1)dθ1
,
(6)
The quantity B21 in Eq. 6 is known as Bayes factor.
We shall compute this quantity in order to obtain
a Bayesian estimate of the statistical signiﬁcance.
Unlike the frequentist model-comparison tech-
nique, there is no quantitative way to rank between
two models. However, similar to AIC and BIC, a
qualitative criterion based on Jeﬀreys scale is used
to interpret the odds ratio or Bayes factor [44, 56].
A value of > 10 represents strong evidence in fa-
vor of M2, and a value of > 100 represents decisive
evidence [44, 56].

SUMMARY OF DAMA/LIBRA PHASE2
RESULTS
Here, we provide a succinct summary of the key results
in the latest data release paper from DAMA/LIBRA [19],
which we later try to reproduce. For more details, the
reader can consult Ref. [19].
The total data presented in Ref. [19] for 1-3 keV
and 1-6 keV corresponds to six annual cycles of the
DAMA/LIBRA phase II, with a total exposure of 1.13
ton year.
The data in the 2-6 keV energy bin corre-
sponds to the DAMA/LIBRA phase II data combined
with data from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA phase I
(collected over 14 annual cycles), with a total exposure of
2.46 ton years. We note that there is an overlap in energy
between the diﬀerent intervals. In previous DAMA pa-
pers [15–18] containing a combination of data from phase
I of DAMA/LIBRA experiment as well as DAMA/NaI,
single-hit rates were also presented in the 2-4 keV, 2-5
keV, and 2-6 keV energy intervals.
The DAMA Collaboration looks for an annual modu-
lation signature indicative of a dark matter signal, which
must satisfy some basic characteristics such as a period
of one year, a phase peaking roughly around June 2nd,
occurring only in single-hit events, and the modulation
amplitude having at most 7% of the DC amplitude [19].
The dataset used for this search consists of residual rates
of the single-hit scintillation events in each energy in-
terval, after subtracting a constant background.
This
constant background is obtained after averaging the rate
per detector in each energy interval over all the annual
cycles [61]. The dataset has been binned into unequal

4
size binned intervals. The median bin size is 19.9, 20.43,
25.0,25.27, and 21.78 for the 2018 1-6 keV, 2018 1-3 keV,
2012 2-5 keV, 2012 2-4 keV and 2-6 keV data (from 2012
and 2018) respectively. The single-hit residual rates in
DAMA/LIBRA phase 2 have been ﬁt to the following
cosine function
H1(x) = A cos ω(x −t0),
(7)
where ω = 2π
T
corresponding to period T. Their best-
ﬁt values are given by T ∼1 year, t0 ∼152.5 days (at
around June 2), and A ∼0.01 cpd/kg/keV. The reduced
χ2 for all the ﬁts are close to 1 and can be found in Table
1 of Ref. [19]. The statistical signiﬁcance of this annual
modulation corresponds to a Z-score of 8.0σ, 9.6σ, and
8.7σ in 1-3 keV, 1-6 keV, and 2-6 keV energy intervals
respectively. When the 2-6 keV data is combined with
data from DAMA/NaI and phase 1 of DAMA/LIBRA,
the signiﬁcance gets enhanced to 12.9σ. In the 2012 data
release from DAMA/LIBRA, the signiﬁcance of annual
modulation in 2-4 and 2-5 keV intervals was 7.6σ.
IV.
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
For our analysis, the data and the associated errors in
the plots (from Ref. [19]) in each energy interval have
been digitized 2. The published data consists of single-
hit residual rates in three diﬀerent energy intervals. Each
data point consists of experimental errors in the resid-
ual rates, as well as the associated time widths as errors
in the independent variable. The abscissa values range
from 6200 to 8300 days for 1-3 and 1-6 keV energy inter-
vals and from 3000 to 8300 days for 2-6 keV interval(cf.
Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref. [19]).
In order to independently evaluate the signiﬁcance of
the apparent annual modulation present in the signal, we
use both a constant function, given by
H0(x) = k,
(8)
and the cosine model in Eqn. 7 as two diﬀerent models,
and compare the best ﬁts for both of them. Initially, we
estimate the best-ﬁt parameters for both these hypothe-
ses. This is the ﬁrst step towards model comparison. The
constant function is then considered as the null hypoth-
esis and model comparison is carried out accordingly.
A.
Parameter Estimation
The ﬁrst step in model comparison involves estimating
the best-ﬁt parameters of a given model. For this pur-
pose, we construct a χ2 function between the data and
2 The raw DAMA data presented in their papers is not publicly
available to the best of our knowledge
a given model. We also include the errors in the time
bin. Although, no details of the χ2 functional used for
minimization is provided in Ref. [19] or in earlier papers,
most likely their χ2 does not include the errors in the ab-
scissa. To incorporate the error in the independent time
variable, we follow the method of Ref. [62] and the total
error (σt) is given by:
σt =
s
σ2
H + σ2x
∂H
∂x
2
,
(9)
where σH is the error in residual rate (obtained by digi-
tization of the relevant plots in Ref. [19]), σx is the error
in time variable and
∂H
∂x is obtained from Eq. 7.
We
assume that the error bars provided by DAMA/LIBRA
collaboration are robust and all systematic terms have
been included, and we don’t need to ﬁt for unknown sys-
tematic error terms (for eg. Ref [59] in the context of
periodicity in measurements of Newton’s constant). We
also assume that the amplitude A in Eqn. 7 does not vary
with time. Time-dependence of A is explored in Ref. [38].
The χ2 functional is then given by:
χ2 =
N
X
i=1
yi −H(x)
σt
2
(10)
where H(x) is deﬁned in Eq. 7 and yi denote the residual
single-hit DAMA rates in each time bin i. For ﬁnding
the minimum value of χ2, we have kept free all the three
parameters of the cosine function.
For each of the given sets of data in the 2-4, 2-5, 1-3, 1-
6, 2-6 keV range, the data is ﬁt to both the hypotheses by
minimizing the χ2 in Eq. 10 to obtain the best-ﬁt param-
eters. The parameters obtained for all the energy ranges
are displayed in Table I for the cosine and also the con-
stant models. The values of parameters obtained for the
cosine model, H1(x) agree within 1σ compared to those
found by the DAMA collaboration [19].
Fig. 1 repre-
sents the best-ﬁt constant value as obtained for H0(x) for
each energy range, along with the best ﬁt cosine wave ob-
tained, in comparison to the cosine wave with the best-ﬁt
parameters presented by the DAMA collaboration [18].
B.
Frequentist Model Comparison
From the ﬁgures, we see that the cosine model appears
to ﬁt the data very well for all the ﬁve sets of data. To
quantify this goodness of ﬁt, we calculate the value of
χ2/DOF, and additionally the value of χ2 probability
as deﬁned in Section II, hereafter denoted as GOF for
goodness of ﬁt. It is expected that for reasonably good
ﬁts, the value of χ2/DOF will be close to 1. The values
of χ2/DOF and GOF are indicated in Table II. We see
that the values of χ2/DOF are much closer to 1 for the
cosine model than for the constant model. Additionally,
the GOF values for the cosine model are of the order
of 10−2, whereas for the constant model the values are

FIG. 1: The DAMA data points (red) in each energy range, namely 2-4 keV, 2-5 keV, 1-3 keV, 1-6 keV, and 2-6 keV, are overlaid
with both the corresponding calculated ﬁts of H1(x) (Eq. 7) to the data, as well as the ﬁts the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration
calculated, as depicted in the ﬁrst set of values in Table 1 of Ref. [19]. The sinusoidal ﬁt calculated by this work is depicted in
purple while that calculated by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration is shown in cyan. The calculated ﬁt for H0(x) is also shown.
O(10−6).
Thus, we can reasonably conclude that the
cosine model provides a better ﬁt to the data. Further,
the time period of the observed ﬁt is very close to 1 year,
and the phase oﬀset, t0 is comparable to the required
152.5 days. Thus, the frequentist test strongly supports
annual modulation.
As noted in Sect. II, it is possible to take advantage
of the fact that the constant model is nested within the
cosine model (when A = 0), and apply Wilk’s theorem
to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the cosine model
in comparison to the null hypothesis. Thus, the diﬀer-
ence in χ2 between the constant and the cosine models
follows a χ2 distribution with DOF = 2 [45, 49]. From
the distributions obtained, we calculate the p-value of
the cosine model for each set of data separately, from
the cumulative distribution of the χ2 functional. The p-
values obtained are depicted alongside the diﬀerence in
χ2 values in Table III. The p-value can be interpreted
as the probability that we would see data that favours
the cosine model by chance, given that the null hypoth-
esis is true. Thus, the smaller values of the p-value in-
dicate that the cosine model should be favored over the
constant model. For each of the energy ranges, the corre-
sponding signiﬁcance (or Z−score) is calculated [54, 58].
Its value is given alongside the p-value. These can be
found in Table III. We note that the signiﬁcance values
are comparable (within ±1σ) to the values indicated in
the DAMA/LIBRA ﬁndings, presented in Refs. [18, 19].
C.

Subsequently, we proceed to calculate the diﬀerence

the cosine model, where the values are calculated using
Eqns. 1 and 2. In general, the model with the smaller AIC
and BIC values is preferred. The ∆AIC and ∆BIC values
can be found in Table III, where the cosine model has
the smaller value. From the diﬀerence in AIC and BIC
values, we evaluate the signiﬁcance using the qualitative
“strength of evidence rules” provided in Ref. [43]. As all
the values of ∆AIC and ∆BIC are in the range of 50-
100, they provide very strong evidence against the null
hypothesis, according to the aforementioned scale.
D.
Bayesian Analysis
Finally, we proceed to calculate the Bayesian odds ra-
tio B21 for the M2 model in comparison to the M1 hy-
pothesis. For this purpose, we consider the null hypoth-
esis to be M1 and the cosine model to be M2. Each set
of points in a given energy range is separately considered
as data D, and B21 is calculated for each energy range,
namely 2-4 keV, 2-5 keV, 1-3 keV, 1-6 keV, and 2-6 keV.
We initially need to calculate the Bayesian evidence for
each of the two models. The ﬁrst step in the calculation
of Bayesian evidence is the likelihood of the data, given
the model and a set of parameters, and for this purpose
we use a Gaussian likelihood

dence for both the hypotheses, we used the Nestle pack-
age in Python 3, which uses the nested sampling algo-
rithm [63, 64].
The Bayes factor is given by the ratio of Bayesian evi-
dence for the cosine and constant model hypothesis. The
Bayes factors for diﬀerent combinations of datasets and
energy intervals are summarized in Table III. We inter-
pret the Bayes factor using the Jeﬀrey’s Scale [44]. As the
values of Bayes factor are well above 100 for all data sets,
we conclude that they provide decisive evidence against
the null hypothesis.

TABLE III: Summary of model comparison results for the sinusoidal variation to the DAMA data compared to the constant ﬁt
as the null hypothesis, using all three model comparison techniques. The ﬁrst two columns depict the ∆χ2 value between the
constant ﬁt 8 and the cosine model 7 and the p-value obtained using Wilk’s theorem. The third column indicates the Z-score.
The corresponding Z-scores found by the DAMA collaboration can be found in Table 2 of Ref. [19] for the 2018 data and in
Table 4 of Ref. [18]. The next two columns indicate the diﬀerence in AIC and BIC between the two models. Finally, the last
column shows the Bayes factor between the two models. As we can see, the sinusoidal model is decisively favored over the
constant model using all the three techniques.
V.
SEARCHES FOR HIGHER HARMONICS
We now address the question as to whether higher har-
monics are present in DAMA/LIBRA data, in addition
to the cosine signal with a period of one year. This ques-
tion has been previously addressed in some of the papers
by the DAMA collaboration [17–19, 65] and also by other
authors [37]. The DAMA collaboration has used an ordi-
nary periodogram as well as the Lomb-Scargle (L-S, here-
after) periodogram to look for higher harmonics. The L-S
periodogram [66, 67] is an extension of the ordinary pe-
riodogram, and is a widely used technique in astronomy
and particle physics to look for periodicities in unevenly
sampled datasets. A recent comprehensive review of the
L-S periodogram (including all its variants) can be found
in Ref. [68].
The DAMA collaboration could not ﬁnd any additional
peaks (other than one year) in these periodograms for the
data in the 2-6 keV energy intervals, when they scanned
the frequencies up to the Nyquist limit of 0.5/per day
(corresponding to a period of 2 days). They also found
that the 6-14 keV energy range does not contain any
peaks in the periodogram, and is consistent with only
noise [19, 65].
An independent L-S analysis of the digitized DAMA
data was carried out in Ref. [37], wherein the authors also
criticized some aspects of the analysis procedure of the
DAMA collaboration [17]. Sturrock et al have pointed
out that the DAMA L-S analysis does not incorporate the
experimental errors.
Sturrock et al [37] independently
analyzed the DAMA data until 2010 using three diﬀer-
ent variants of the standard L-S periodogram and found
signiﬁcance for annual modulation at the level of 5.8σ to
6.6σ. They also pointed out some limitations in search-
ing for higher harmonics in the publicly available DAMA
data, which is binned. One caveat is that the maximum
frequency which can be searched for is determined by the
size of the time bin. Another problem in searching for
higher harmonics in the DAMA data is that the residu-
als are calculated by subtracting the mean on an annual
basis, but the mean value has not been made publicly
available. Nevertheless, their analysis also did not ﬁnd
any evidence for any higher harmonics [37].
We did an independent search for higher harmonics in
the 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV energy range.
For this pur-
pose, we used the generalized [69] or ﬂoating-mean [70]
periodogram, in which an oﬀset term is added at each fre-
quency. This generalized periodogram has been shown to
be more sensitive than the normal L-S periodogram [68].
We have previously used this version of the generalized
L-S periodogram to look for periodicities in beta decay
rates and solar neutrino ﬂuxes [53, 71].
For our anal-
ysis, we implemented this generalized L-S periodogram
using the LombScargle class in the astropy [72] mod-
ule. The DAMA collaboration and Ref. [37] have looked
for higher harmonics from the periodograms of the raw
DAMA residual data itself, which is already indicative of
annual modulation. In principle, this data can also be
used to detect additional periodic components with high
amplitudes. However, since the L-S periodogram is es-
sentially equivalent to a single-term sinusoidal ﬁt to the
data at each frequency, the generalization to multiple fre-
quencies can lead to spurious periodogram peaks [56, 68]
Therefore, as a complementary approach to the previous
analysis in Ref. [37] and DAMA collaboration [19], we
search for higher harmonics from the residuals, obtained
from the subtracting the best ﬁt cosine with a period of
one year. We however note that we also applied the gen-
eralized L-S periodogram on the raw DAMA data, but
we do not report the results here, as they are not dif-
ferent than the analysis done on the residuals, which we
now present.
These residuals are calculated by subtracting the best-
ﬁt value for the cosine model from the DAMA data, pre-
sented in Table I. Since the DAMA data is binned, the
maximum frequency which we can search for is limited by

8
the bin size. The median time bin width for the DAMA
data in the 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV interval is equal to 19.9
and 21.8 days respectively. Since both these values are
close to 20 days, the maximum frequency which we search
in both the energy bins is equal to a period of 20 days,
or a frequency of 18 /per year. If the DAMA collabora-
tion released their data in one-day bins, one could have
searched for periodicities at higher frequencies as well,
similar to what was done in some of the papers by the
DAMA collaboration.
Our results are shown in Fig. 2 for both 1-6 keV and
2-6 keV energy intervals. The normalization convention,
which we have used for L-S periodogram can be found in
Ref. [68]. For both these energy intervals, we can again
see a peak at a frequency of 1 year.
The only other
peak which we see in the 1-6 keV interval is at a fre-
quency of 9.13 per year corresponding to the L-S power
of 0.38. This corresponds to a p-value of 0.004 with a
Z-score of 2.64σ. The p−value has been calculated using
the prescription of Baluev [73]. This same peak at 9.13
per year is also seen in the 2-6 keV energy region with
a L-S power of 0.21. The p-value for this peak is 0.0066
with a Z-score of 2.47σ. We note however that this fre-
quency of 9.13/year corresponds to a period of about 40
days and is close to the median bin width of the DAMA
data. Furthermore, it is not very signiﬁcant. More data
in smaller time widths is needed to get a more robust
estimate of its signiﬁcance and to see if this peak persists
with additional data.
VI.
SENSITIVITY OF COSINE-100 AND
ANAIS-112 SEARCHES
Two other dark matter experiments sensitive to annual
modulation, which use NaI as target and designed to test
the DAMA results, namely COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112
have started taking data and released preliminary results
with a lifetime of about a year
[32, 33]. We have also
carried out an independent search for annual modulation
with the same data using all the four model independent
techniques used here [74, 75]. Currently, the ANAIS-112
and COSINE-100 exposures are not very large to robustly
discriminate between a background only versus signal
only hypothesis.
However, this can change with more
accumulated exposure. Therefore, we investigate using
numerical experiments on how the signiﬁcance would
change as a function of exposure time, if the data con-
tained a real sinusoidal signal as well as if the data con-
tained only background. We note that more detailed sen-
sitivity analysis of the DAMA parameter space has been
done by the COSINE-100 [76] and ANAIS-112 [77, 78]
collaborations, which take into account experimental de-
tails such as detection eﬃciency, quenching factors. etc.
Here, we investigate using synthetic data how the metrics
we have used for model comparison with real data (fre-
quentist signiﬁcance, AIC, BIC, Bayes factor) would help
adjudicate between a true signal and noise, as a function
of exposure time.
Since both COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 experiments
have similar detector ﬁducial mass (O (100 kg)) and
background rates (2-4 cpd/kg/keV), we consider the sen-
sitivity of an hypothetical dark matter experiment de-
signed to detect annual modulation, which would mimic
the behaviour of both these experiments. Our numerical
experiments should give an idea of how the model com-
parison metrics we have considered in this work change
as a function of the exposure time and are sensitive to
a real signal. We ﬁrst describe the results, assuming the
detector data stream only contains noise. We injected
a cosine signal with the same period and phase as de-
tected by DAMA collaboration and with diﬀerent am-
plitudes (to emulate diﬀerent signal to noise ratios) in
order to ascertain the sensitivity as a function of signal
to background ratio. We now present results for model
comparison analysis for the same.
A.
Results with only background
We ﬁrst describe the recipe used to generate ﬁve years
worth of simulated detector background, which can be
used to look for dark-matter induced signals. Since the
search for dark matter-induced signals is done using the
residual data, which is obtained by subtracting the expo-
nential background, we create a synthetic dataset of the
residual data, based on the observed ANAIS-112 residual
data, which is publicly available [32]. Since the COSINE-
100 background rate (2.7 cpd/kg/keV/ is of the same or-
der of magnitude as the ANAIS-112 background rate (2-
4 cpd/kg/keV), this synthetic background only dataset
should also be representative of the COSINE-100 exper-
iment.
We assume that the data has been binned in
10-day intervals (similar to ANAIS-112). The time bin-
ning assumed for the COSINE-100 data is also similar
(15 days). One simpliﬁcation, we have made is that our
simulated experiment consists of only one module. In re-
ality, both COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 consist of mul-
tiple modules, and data from all these modules is used
concurrently to search for a cosine signal.
For ﬁve years worth of synthetic data, we generated 184
normal random deviates with mean of zero and scale pa-
rameter same as the COSINE-100 residual background,
equal to 0.035 cpd/kg/keV (obtained from Fig. 2 of
Ref. [32]). Since the distribution of the ANAIS-112 resid-
uals is close to a Gaussian distribution, therefore our sim-
ulated dataset should emulate the observed backgrounds
in these experiments. Each simulated data point encap-
sulates the background rate within a 10-day interval. To
simulate the error distribution of the background data,
we generated normal deviates with mean obtained from
the median error of the ANAIS-112 residual rates (equal
to 0.031 cpd/kg/keV) and scale parameter, which mim-
ics the distribution of the errors in the same data. The
above simulated ﬁve years data-stream was then used for
model comparison. We used a subset of the above data

FIG. 2: Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram [69] of the DAMA best-ﬁt residuals in 1-6 keV (top ﬁgure) and 2-6 keV (bottom
ﬁgure). These residuals have been computed by subtracting the best-ﬁt values for the period of 1 year. The residuals still show
the peak at 1 year. In addition to this, both the periodograms show an additional peak at a frequency of 9.13 per year (period
of 40 days), with p-values of 0.004 (2.64σ) and 0.0066 (2.47σ) in 1-6 and 2-6 keV energy intervals. Therefore the signiﬁcance
is marginal and furthermore, the period of 40 days is close to the median DAMA bin size of 20 days.
to do a similar analysis for one and three years worth of
data.
We now ﬁt this data to both a cosine signal (with the
period ﬁxed to the DAMA best ﬁt value of a year and
both amplitude and phase as free parameters) as well as
a constant background rate and carry out model com-
parison in the same way as done for the real data. We
note that the best-ﬁt maximum likelihood estimate for a
constant background is given by the weighted mean [79]
of the simulated data along with the simulated error dis-
tribution. Our results are shown in Table IV. We ﬁnd
that although all the model comparison tests prefer the
constant model over a cosine model, the signiﬁcance for
both the models is comparable for all the three exposures
considered, and none of the tests can robustly discrimi-
nate between the two hypotheses. One possible reason for
this is that the ﬂuctuations of the simulated background
is large and a constant background does not adequately
ﬁt all the data points. For a smaller background scale pa-
rameter and with smaller error bars, the metrics would
more robustly favor a constant model.
B.
Results with simulated cosine signal
The DAMA best-ﬁt value for the amplitude of the co-
sine signal is ∼0.01 cpd/kg/keV. The actual detectabil-
ity of this signal in another dark matter experiment
would depend upon the signal to noise ratio (or the ra-
tio of amplitude of signal to that of the background). In
lieu of more realistic background models for the residual
rates (which can be done by the experimental collabo-
rations), we added simulated signals with two diﬀerent
amplitudes to the simulated backgrounds (described in
previous sub-section) in order to assess the signiﬁcance
with diﬀerent signal to noise ratios. Our simulated cosine
signal has a period of one year and a phase of 159 days,
identical to the best-ﬁt values found by the DAMA col-
laboration. The values of the injected amplitudes are 0.01
cpd/kg/keV and 0.02 cpd/kg/keV. For the background

signiﬁcance is not strong enough to decisively favor any one model over the other.

scale parameter of 0.035 cpd/kg/keV, this corresponds
to a SNR of 0.28 and 0.57 respectively. We note that
the results with the SNR of 0.57 would be identical for
a signal with amplitude of 0.01 cpd/kg/keV and with a
background scale parameter half of our currently simu-
lated value. We note that for doing the ﬁts (similar to
the analysis of data with only noise), the period of the
cosine signal was kept ﬁxed at one year. Only the am-
plitude and phase were allowed to vary. Our results for
SNRs of 0.28 and 0.57 can be found in Tables V and VI.
We note that for the SNR of 0.28 (Tab. V), after
one year of data, the diﬀerent model comparison tests
marginally prefer a constant model. After three years of
data, all the tests prefer the cosine model. However, only
the Bayes factor provides substantial evidence for the co-
sine model according to the Jeﬀreys scale [44]. After ﬁve
years of data, both AIC and Bayes factor provide strong
evidence for the cosine model.
For the signals with SNR of 0.57 (Tab. VI), after the
ﬁrst year of data, except BIC, all the other tests very
marginally prefer the cosine model.
After three years
of accumulated exposure, the information theory based
tests and Bayes factor show decisive evidence for a cosine
signal. The Z-score for the frequentist test after three
years is 4.5σ and increases to 6σ only after ﬁve years.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that the Bayes factor is most sensitive
in detecting the cosine signal even for weak amplitudes.

CONCLUSIONS
The DAMA experiment, which looks for direct detec-
tion of dark matter, has found evidence for annual mod-
ulation for more than 20 years, with all the right charac-
teristics to be caused by galactic dark matter scattering.
In their latest data release paper from phase 2 of their up-
graded experiment (called DAMA/LIBRA) [19], the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance ranges from 8σ and 12.9σ, depending
on the energy intervals and durations [19].
This statistical signiﬁcance has been evaluated using a
frequentist technique, which involves comparing the dif-
ference in χ2 between the null hypothesis and sinusoidal
model. From this diﬀerence, a p-value can calculated us-
ing Wilk’s theorem, which is then converted to a Z-score

and simulated cosine signal with amplitude A = 0.02 cpd/kg/keV, equivalent to a SNR (deﬁned in Table V) of 0.6. We ﬁnd

or signiﬁcance, in terms of number of sigmas.
In this work, we independently assess the DAMA claim
for annual modulation using the same frequentist model
comparison technique, by including the errors in the in-
dependent time-variable.
Furthermore, we use model
comparison tests from information theory and Bayesian
analysis, which are routinely used in Cosmology.
For
the information theory tests, we used the Akaike Infor-
mation Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion to
evaluate the signiﬁcance. From the diﬀerence, the sig-
niﬁcance was evaluated using qualitative strength of ev-
idence rules.
For Bayesian model comparison, we cal-
culated the marginal likelihood or Bayesian evidence for
both the hypotheses. For this purpose, we assumed uni-
form priors on all the models. We then calculated the
Bayes factor from the ratio of the marginal likelihood
and used Jeﬀrey’s scale to evaluate the signiﬁcance.
A tabular summary of all our model comparison tests
can be found in Table III. The Bayesian and information
theoretical comparison tests also point to very strong ev-
idence for annual modulation and agree with the frequen-
tist tests.
We also performed a search for higher harmonics in the
DAMA data by looking at the residual signal, obtained
by subtracting the best-ﬁt annual modulation signal from
the raw residual background. We applied the generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodogram [68, 69] to this residual data
and found another peak in both 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV data
at a period of 40 days. However, the signiﬁcance is very
low (< 3σ) and this period is close to the DAMA bin size
of around 20 days. So more data is necessary to ascertain
if the observed signiﬁcance of this peak increases.
Finally, we also carried out numerical experiments to
check how robustly the diﬀerent model comparison tech-
niques would help discriminate between the two hypothe-
sis for a dark matter experiment sensitive to annual mod-
ulation, using a simulated data stream consisting of pure
background as well as a superposition of pure background
and cosine signal with diﬀerent amplitudes. The simu-
lated background has been designed to mimic the residual
background of the recently released ANAIS-112 data [32].
We ﬁnd that if the data contained only background, none
of the model comparison techniques used can decisively
select any one model (cf. Table IV). When we injected
signals with two diﬀerent amplitudes, corresponding to
SNRs of 0.28 and 0.57 (cf. Tables V and VI), we ﬁnd
that the Bayes factor is the most sensitive and can pro-
vide decisive evidence for the cosine signal even for SNR
of 0.28 after ﬁve years of exposure and after three years
for SNR of 0.56.
This is the ﬁrst proof of principles application of
information theoretic and Bayesian model comparison
techniques to evaluate the annual modulation claim in
DAMA and to analyze the sensitivity of other dark mat-
ter experiments such as ANAIS-112 and COSINE-100 to
look for such signals.
