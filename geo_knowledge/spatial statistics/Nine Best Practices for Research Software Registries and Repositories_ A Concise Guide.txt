Nine Best Practices for Research Software Registries and Repositories:
A Concise Guide
Task Force on Best Practices for Software Registries*
23 December 2020
Scientiﬁc software registries and repositories serve various roles in their respective disciplines. These resources
improve software discoverability and research transparency, provide information for software citations, and foster
preservation of computational methods that might otherwise be lost over time, thereby supporting research
reproducibility and replicability. However, developing these resources takes effort, and few guidelines are available
to help prospective creators of registries and repositories. To address this need, we present a set of nine best practices
that can help managers deﬁne the scope, practices, and rules that govern individual registries and repositories.
These best practices were distilled from the experiences of the creators of existing resources, convened by a Task
Force of the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group during the years 2019–2020. We believe that
putting in place speciﬁc policies such as those presented here will help scientiﬁc software registries and repositories
better serve their users and their disciplines.

Introduction
Scientiﬁc software registries and repositories serve various roles in their respective disciplines. Registries
are typically indexes or catalogs of software stored elsewhere, while repositories are both indexes and
places where software is stored. Both types of resource improve software discoverability and research
transparency, provide information for software citations, and foster preservation of computational meth-
ods that might otherwise be lost over time, thereby supporting research reproducibility and replicability.
Many provide or are integrated with other services, including indexing and archival services, which can
be leveraged by librarians, digital archivists, journal editors and publishers, and researchers alike.
Having speciﬁc policies in place for software registries and repositories ensures that users and administra-
tors have reference documents to help deﬁne a shared understanding of the scope, practices, and rules
that govern these collections. These practices can prove useful in a variety of situations, including, but not
limited to, presenting the contents in the resource to stakeholders and community members, reassuring
potential contributors by clarifying sensitive issues such as attribution, and deﬁning how content in a
registry or repository can be (re)used by others.
The best practices presented here were proposed and developed by a Task Force of the FORCE11 Software
Citation Implementation Working Group. The members of the Task Force were managers and editors of
scientiﬁc software registries and repositories. Development of the best practices began with a series of
monthly conference calls in 2019 and continued at the Scientiﬁc Software Registry Collaboration Workshop,
a two-day workshop held at the University of Maryland in November, 2019, with generous funding from
the Sloan Foundation. In 2020, the Task Force made additional reﬁnements to the best practices during
virtual meetings and through online collaborative writing. The Authors section lists the people who
participated.
Each guideline is presented below with an explanation as to why we recommend the practice, what the
practice describes or contains, and speciﬁc considerations to take into account. Our recommendations
are partitioned into nine separate policies or statements, though there is inescapable overlap between
some of them. In practice, the statements and policies are often combined into a smaller number of
documents, as is evident in most of the real-world examples presented at the end of this document.
To reduce repetition in the descriptions of the guidelines, we often refer to registries and repositories
collectively as “resources” and “collections.”
These nine best practices, though not an exhaustive list, are applicable to the varied resources represented
in the Task Force, so are likely to be broadly applicable to other scientiﬁc software repositories and reg-
istries. We believe that adopting these practices will help document, guide, and preserve these resources,
and put them in a stronger position to serve their disciplines, users, and communities.
2

Best Practice: Provide a public scope statement
Why we recommend this: A scope statement clariﬁes the type of software contained in the repository
or indexed in the registry. This manages the expectations of the potential depositor of metadata and/or
software, as well as the resource seeker. It informs both of what the collection does and does not contain.
This should describe:
• What is accepted, and acceptable
• What is not accepted
• Exceptions to either/both of the above if necessary
What you might consider when writing a scope statement:
• Deﬁning the community being served
• The types of software listed in the registry or stored in the repository, such as source code or
compiled executables
• Criteria that must be satisﬁed by accepted software, such as whether certain software quality metrics
must be fulﬁlled or whether the software must be used in published research
• Whether the code has to be in the public domain and/or have a license from a predeﬁned set
• Whether software registered in another registry or repository will be accepted
3

Best Practice: Provide guidance for users
Why we recommend this: Different users of the registry or repository will beneﬁt from having guidance
on how to access the information they are interested in. For example, it is useful to describe how to search
the collection, answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), provide tips and tricks, and to let users know
who to contact for assistance.
A separate section in these guidelines on the Conditions of use policy covers terms of use of the collection,
including data and API, and how best to cite records in the resource and the resource itself. Guidance
for users who wish to contribute software is covered in the next section, Provide guidance to software
contributors.
This should describe:
• How to perform common user tasks
• Answers to questions that are often asked or can be anticipated
• Whom to contact for questions or help
What you might consider when writing guidance for users:
• Identifying the types of users your resource has or could potentially have, and corresponding use
cases
• Offering multiple forms of guidance, such as in-ﬁeld prompts, linked explanations, and completed
examples
• If there is an API, including a description specifying the interface or a pointer to the ofﬁcial docu-
mentation for the interface
• If content negotiation is enabled, stating what formats, such as JSON-LD or XML, are supported
4

Best Practice: Provide guidance to software contributors
Why we recommend this: People interested in contributing software entries to the registry or repository
need to know what the process entails. The scope statement will already have explained what is accepted
and what is not; the contributor policy addresses who can add or change software entries, and the
processes involved.
This should describe:
• Who can or cannot submit entries and/or metadata
• Required and optional metadata expected from software contributors
• Review process, if any
• Curation process, if any
• Procedures for updates (e.g., who can do it, when it is done, how is it done)
What you might consider when writing a contributor policy:
• Deﬁning who can submit and/or update entries
• Whether the author(s) of the software will be contacted if the contributor is not also an author, and
whether contact is a condition or side-effect of the submission
• Stating how persistent identiﬁers are assigned (if they are used)
• Including a statement that depositors must comply with all applicable laws and not be intentionally
malicious
5

Best Practice: Establish an authorship policy
Why we recommend this: Establishing a policy dedicated to authorship ensures that people are given due
credit for their work. It also serves as a document that administrators can turn to in case authorial disputes
arise and allows for proactive problem mitigation, rather than having to resort to reactive interpretation.
Further, having an authorship policy is in keeping with similar policies by journals and publishers. Having
such explicit authorship policies is thus part of a larger trend. Note that the authorship policy will be
communicated at least partially to users through guidance provided to software contributors.
This should describe:
• Who should be listed as an author of the software
• Policies around making changes to authorship
• How authorship disputes are handled
• What the resource will do in case of conﬂict
What you might consider when writing an authorship policy:
• Taking into consideration whether those who are not coders, such as software testers or documen-
tation maintainers, will be identiﬁed or credited as authors, as well as criteria for ordering the list of
authors in cases of multiple authors
• How the resource handles large numbers of authors and group or consortium authorship
• Including guidelines about how changes to authorship are handled
• What role the registry will play, if any, in authorship disputes, and if so, how they are handled
• Maintaining consistency with the citation policies for the registry/repository
• Using a credit ontology (e.g., https://casrai.org/credit/) to describe authors’ contributions
6

Best Practice: Share your metadata schema
Why we recommend this: For individual and organizational users interested in the information in reg-
istries and repositories, revealing the metadata schema used for the entries helps users understand the
structure and properties of the deposited information. The metadata structure helps to inform users how
they might interact with or ingest records in the collection. A metadata schema mapped to other schemas
and an API speciﬁcation can improve the interoperability between registries and repositories.
This should describe:
• What schema is used (e.g., CodeMeta, Schema.org) and its version number if a published standard
schema is used, or, if a custom schema is used, a description of the schema and/or a data dictionary
• Where the metadata documentation or its ofﬁcial site can be found
• What metadata is expected when submitting software, including which ﬁelds are required and
which are optional, and the format of the content in each ﬁeld
What you might consider when stating your metadata schema:
• Using a metadata schema that is mapped (“cross-walked”) to published standard schemas, or
providing a cross-walk between your schema and other schemas
• Providing an example of the metadata schema with a complete entry in your repository that illus-
trates all the ﬁelds of the schema
7

Best Practice: Stipulate conditions of use
Why we recommend this: A conditions of use policy lets users of your resource know how the metadata of
the registry or repository can be used, attributed, and/or cited. It provides information about licensing and
forestalls potential liabilities and difﬁculties that may arise, such as claims of damage for misinterpretation
or misapplication of metadata. In turn, it clearly states how the metadata can and cannot be used,
including for commercial purposes and in aggregate form.
This should describe:
• Legal disclaimers about the responsibility and liability borne by the registry or repository
• License and copyright information, both for individual entries and for the registry or repository as a
whole
• Conditions for the use of the metadata, including prohibitions, if any
• Preferred format for citing software entries
• Preferred format for attributing or citing the resource itself
What you might consider when writing a conditions of use policy:
• What license governs your metadata, and whether there are licensing requirements for ﬁndings
and/or derivatives of the resource
• Whether there are differences in the terms and license for commercial versus noncommercial use
• Conditions for the use of the API if one is available
• Restrictions on use of the metadata
• Including a statement to the effect that the registry or repository makes no guarantees about
completeness and is not liable for any damages that may arise from the use of the information
8

Best Practice: State a privacy policy
Why we recommend this: Having a privacy policy demonstrates a strong commitment to the privacy of
users of the registry or repository, and allows the resource to comply with the legal requirement of many
countries in addition to those a home institution and/or funding agencies may impose. A privacy policy
discloses what information, analytics, and metrics a registry collects and/or retains about its users and
why.
This should describe:
• What information is collected and how long it is retained
• How the information, especially any personal data, is used
• Whether tracking is done, what is tracked, and how (e.g., Google Analytics)
• Whether cookies are used
What you might consider when writing a privacy policy:
• Detailing the speciﬁc data collected, why it is collected, and whether it is shared or sold
• Being explicit about third party tools used to collect analytic information and potentially referencing
their privacy policies
• Stating whether users will receive email as a result of visiting or downloading content
• Explaining the measures taken to protect users’ privacy, and whether the resource complies with
the European Union Directive on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other local laws, if
applicable
• Reserving the right to make changes to the Privacy Policy
• Deﬁning a mechanism by which users can request information be removed
9

Best Practice: Provide a retention policy
Why we recommend this: Software registries and repositories make an implicit promise to retain records
for some period of time, but for various reasons may have to remove records. Common examples include
removing entries that are outdated or no longer meet the scope of the registry or are found to be in
violation of policies. The collection should document retention goals so that users and depositors are
aware of them.
This should describe:
• The length of time metadata and/or ﬁles are expected to be retained
• Under what conditions metadata and/or ﬁles are removed
• Who has the responsibility and ability to remove information
• Procedures to request that metadata and/or ﬁles be removed
What you might consider when writing a retention policy:
• If assigning identiﬁers, whether best practices for persistent identiﬁers are followed, including
resolvability, retention, and non-reuse of those identiﬁers
• Making sure the length of time is not too prescriptive (e.g., “for the next 10 years”), but rather ﬁts
within the context of the underlying organization(s) and its funding
• Stating who is allowed to edit metadata, delete records, or delete ﬁles, and if so, how these changes
are documented and consistent with the registry broadly
• Explaining the process by which data may be taken ofﬂine and archived as well as the process for its
possible retrieval
10

Best Practice: Disclose your end-of-life policy
Why we recommend this: Sharing a clear end-of-life policy increases trust in the community served by
your registry or repository. It demonstrates a thoughtful commitment to users by informing them that
provisions for the artifacts contained in the resource have been considered should the resource close or
otherwise end its services for these artifacts. Such a policy sets expectations and provides reassurance as
to how long the records within the resource will be ﬁndable and accessible in the future.
This should describe:
• Under what circumstances the resource might end its services
• What consequences would result from closure
• What will happen to the metadata and/or the software artifacts contained in the resource in the
event of closure
• If long-term preservation is expected, where metadata and/or software artifacts will be migrated for
preservation
• How a migration will be funded
What you might consider when writing a end-of-life policy:
• Whether the records will remain available, and if so, how and for whom, and under which conditions,
such as archived status or “read only”, should the collection close
• What restrictions, if any, may apply
• Establishing a formal agreement or MOU with another registry, repository, or institution to receive
and preserve the data or project, if applicable
