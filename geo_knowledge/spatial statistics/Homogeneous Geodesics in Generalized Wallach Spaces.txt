Introduction
Let (M, g) be a homogeneous Riemannian manifold, i.e. a connected Riemannian
manifold on which the largest connected group G of isometries acts transitively. Then
M can be expressed as a homogeneous space (G/K, g) where K is the isotropy group at
a ﬁxed pointed o of M, and g is a G-invariant metric. In this case the Lie algebra g of
G has an Ad(K)-invariant decomposition g = k ⊕m, where m ⊂g is a linear subspace
of g and k is the Lie algebra of K. In general such decomposition is not unique. The
ad(K)-invariant subspace m can be naturally identiﬁed with the tangent space ToM
via the projection π : G →G/K.
A geodesic γ(t) through the origin o of M = G/K is called homogeneous if it is an
orbit of a one-parameter subgroup of G, that is
γ(t) = exp(tX)(o),
t ∈R,
(1)
where X is a non zero vector of g.
A homogeneous Riemannian manifold is called a g.o.
space, if all geodesics are
homogeneous with respect to the largest connected group of isometries. All naturally
reductive spaces are g.o. spaces ([15]), but the converse is not true in general. In [13] A.
Kaplan proved the existence of g.o. spaces that are in no way naturally reductive. These
are generalized Heisenberg groups with two-dimensional center. In [16] O. Kowalski, F.
Pr¨ufer and L. Vanhecke made an explicit classiﬁcation of all naturally reductive spaces
up to dimension ﬁve. In [18] O. Kowalski and L. Vanhecke gave a classiﬁcation of all
g.o. spaces, which are in no way naturally reductive, up to dimension six. In [11] C.
Gordon described g.o. spaces which are nilmanifolds and in [29] H. Tamaru classiﬁed
homogeneous g.o. spaces which are ﬁbered over irreducible symmetric spaces. In [6]
and [7] O. Kowalski and Z. Duˇsek investigated homogeneous geodesics in Heisenberh
groups and some H-type groups. Examples of g.o. spaces in dimension seven were
obtained by Duˇsek, O. Kowalski and S. Nikˇcevi´c in ([9]). Also, in [1] the ﬁrst author
and D.V. Alekseevsky classiﬁed generalized ﬂag manifolds which are g.o. spaces.
Concerning the existence of homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Riemannian
manifold, we recall the following. V.V. Kajzer proved that a Lie group endowed with a
left-invariant metric admits at least one homogeneous geodesic ([12]). O. Kowalski and
J. Szenthe extended this result to all homogeneous Riemannian manifolds ([17]). An
extension of the result of [17] to reductive homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds

has been also obtained ([7], [24]). Also, O. Kowalski, S. Nikˇcevi´c and Z. Vl´aˇsek studied
homogeneous geodesics in homogneous Riemannian manifolds ([14]), and G. Calvaruso
and R. Marinosci studied homogeneous geodesics in three-dimension Lie groups ([21],
[5]).
Homogeneous geodesics were studied by J. Szenthe ([25], [26], [27], [28]).
In
addition, D. Latiﬁstudied homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Finsler spaces ([19]),
and the ﬁrst author investigated homogeneous geodesics in the ﬂag manifold SO(2l +
1)/U(l −m) × SO(2m + 1) ([3]).
Homogeneous geodesics in the aﬃne setting were studied in [10].
Finally, D.V.
Alekseevsky and Yu. G. Nikonorov in [2] studied the structure of compact g.o. spaces
and gave some suﬃcient conditions for existence and non existence of an invariant
metric with homogeneous geodesics on a homogeneous space of a compact Lie group
G. They also gave a classiﬁcation of compact simply connected g.o. spaces of positive
Euler characteristic.
Because of these results, it is natural to study g.o. spaces as well as to describe
homogeneous geodesics for other large classes of homogeneous spaces. In this paper,
we study this problem for generalized Wallach spaces. These spaces were well known
before as three-locally-symmetric spaces ([20]), however they were recently classiﬁed
by Z. Chen, Y. Kang and K. Liang ([4]) and Yu.G. Nikonorov ([23]). We search for
homogeneous geodesics in these spaces.
One of the main results in the present paper is Theorem 2, which classiﬁes generalized
Wallach spaces which are g.o. spaces. For those which are not, we show how to obtain
homogeneous geodesics. We make explicit computations for the three dimensional Lie
group SU(2) (thus recovering a result of R.A. Marinosci), and for the Stiefel manifold
SO(4)/SO(2).
The paper is organised as follows: In Section 1 we recall the basic deﬁnitions and
properties of homogeneous geodesics in a Riemannian manifold. In Section 2 we recall
the deﬁnition of generalized Wallach spaces as well as their classiﬁcation from [23]. In
Section 3 we classify g.o. spaces among generalized Wallach spaces. For those which
are not g.o. spaces, in Section 4 we discuss how to ﬁnd all homogeneous geodesics for
a given G-invariant Riemannian metric.

1. Homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Riemannian manifolds
Let (M = G/K, g) be a homogeneous Riemannian manifold. Let g and k be the Lie
algebras of G and K respectively and let
g = k ⊕m
(2)
be a reductive decomposition. The canonical projection π : G →G/K induces an
isomorphism between the subspace m and the tangent space ToM at the identity o =

eK. The G-invariant metric g induces a scalar product ⟨·, ·⟩on m which is Ad(K)-
invariant. Let B(·, ·) = −Killing form on g. Then any Ad(K)-invariant scalar product
⟨·, ·⟩on m can be expressed as ⟨x, y⟩= B(Λx, y) (x, y ∈m), where Λ is an Ad(K)-
equivariant positive deﬁnite symmetric operator on m. Conversely, any such operator
Λ determines an Ad(K)-invariant scalar product ⟨x, y⟩= B(Λx, y) on m, which in turn
determines a G-invariant Riemannian metric g on m. We say that Λ is the operator
associated to the metric g, or simply the associated operator.
Also, a Riemannian
metric generated by inner product B(·, ·) is called standard metric.
Deﬁnition 1. A nonzero vector X ∈g is called a geodesic vector if the curve (1) is a
geodesic.
Lemma 1 ([18]). A nonzero vector X ∈g is a geodesic vector if and only if
⟨[X, Y ]m, Xm⟩= 0,
(3)
for all Y ∈m. Here the subscript m denotes the projection into m.
A useful description of homogeneous geodesics (1) is provided by the following :
Proposition 1 ([1]). Let (M = G/K, g) be a homogeneous Riemannian manifold and
Λ be the associated operator. Let a ∈k and x ∈m. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) The orbit γ(t) = expt(a+x)·o of the one-parameter subgroup expt(a+x) through
the point o = eK is a geodesic of M.
(2) [a + x, Λx] ∈k.
(3) ⟨[a, x], y⟩= ⟨x, [x, y]m⟩for all y ∈m.
(4) ⟨[a + x, y]m, x⟩= 0 for all y ∈m.
An important corollary of Proposition 1 is the following:
Corollary 1 ([1]). Let (M = G/K, g) be a homogeneous Riemannian manifold. Then
(M = G/K, g) is a g.o. space if and only if for every x ∈m there exists an a(x) ∈k
such that
[a(x) + x, Λx] ∈k.
If we want to decide whether a homogeneous Riemannian manifold (M = G/K, g)
is a g.o. space or not, we need to ﬁnd a decomposition of the form (2) and look for
geodesic vectors of the form
X =
s
X
i=1
aiei +
l
X
j=1
xjAj.
(4)
Here {ei : i = 1, 2, . . . , s} is a basis of m and {Aj : j = 1, 2, . . . , l} is a basis of k. By
substituting X into equation (3) we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for
the parameters xj. If for any X ∈m \ {0} this system for the variables xj has real
solutions, then it follows that the homogeneous Riemannian manifold (M = G/K, g)
is a g.o. space.
If, on the other hand, we need to ﬁnd all homogeneous geodesics in the homogeneous
Riemannian manifold (M = G/K, g), then we have to calculate all geodesic vectors in
the Lie algebra g. Condition (3) reduces to a system of s quadratic equations for the
variables xj and ai. Then the geodesic vectors correspond to those solutions of this
system for the variables x1, . . . , xl, a1, . . . , as, which are not all equal to zero.

2. Generalized Wallach spaces
Let G/K be a compact homogeneous space with connected compact semisimple Lie
group G and a compact subgroup K. Denoted by g and k Lie algebras of G and K
respectively. We assume that G/K is almost eﬀective, i.e., there are no non-trial ideals
of the Lie algebra g in k ⊂g. Let ⟨·, ·⟩= B(Λ·, ·) be an Ad(K)-invariant scalar product
on m, where Λ is the associated operator.
We assume that the homogeneous space G/K has the following property. The module
m decomposes into a direct sum of three Ad(K)-invariant irreducible modules pairwise
orthogonal with respect to B, i.e.
m = m1 ⊕m2 ⊕m3,
(5)
such that
[mi, mi] ⊂k
i = 1, 2, 3.
(6)
A homogeneous space with this property are called generalized Wallach space.
Some examples of these spaces are the manifolds of completely ﬂags in the com-
plex, quaternionic, and Cayley projective planes, that is SU(3)/Tmax, Sp(3)/Sp(1) ×
Sp(1) × Sp(1), F4/Spin(8) (known as Wallach spaces), and the generalized ﬂag man-
ifolds SU(n1 + n2 + n3)/S(U(n1) × U(n2) × U(n3)), SO(2n)/U(1) × U(n −1) and
E6/U(1) × U(1) × SO(8).
Every generalized Wallach space admits a three parameter family of invariant Rie-
mannian metrics determined by Ad(K)-invariant inner products
⟨·, ·⟩= λ1B(·, ·) |m1 +λ2B(·, ·) |m2 +λ3B(·, ·) |m3,
(7)
where λ1, λ2, λ3 are positive real numbers.
Let di be the dimension of mi. Let {ej
i} be an orthonormal basis of mj with respect
to B, where j = 1, 2, 3 and 1 ≤i ≤dj. Consider the expression [ijk] deﬁned by the
equality
[ijk] =
X
α,β,γ
B([ei
α, ej
β], ek
γ)2,
(8)
where α, β, γ range from 1 to di, dj and dk respectively (cf. [30]). The symbols [ijk] are
symmetric in all three indices due to the bi-invariance of the metric ⟨·, ·⟩. Moreover,
for the spaces under consideration we have [ijk] = 0, if two induces coincide.
We recall the classiﬁcation of generalized Wallach spaces that was recently obtained
by Yu.G. Nikoronov ([23]) and Z. Chen, Y. Kang, K. Liang ([4]):
Theorem 1 ([23], [4]). Let G/K be a connected and simply connected compact ho-
mogeneous space. Then G/K is a generalized Wallach space if and only if one of the
following types:
1) G/K is a direct product of three irreducible symmetric spaces of compact type
([ijk] = 0 in this case).
2) The group is simple and the pair (g, k) is one of the pairs in Table 1.
3) G = F × F × F × F and H = diag(F) ⊂G for some connected simple connected
compact simple Lie group F, with the following description on the Lie algebra level:
(g, k) = (f ⊕f ⊕f ⊕f, diag(f) = {(X, X, X, X) | X ∈f},
where f is the Lie algebra of F, and (up to permutation) m1 = {(X, X, −X, −X) | X ∈
f}, m2 = {(X, −X, X, −X) | X ∈f}, m3 = {(X, −X, −X, X) | X ∈f}.

3. g.o. generalized Wallach spaces
Let (G/K, g) be a generalized Wallach space with reductive decomposition g = k⊕m,
equipped with a G-invariant metric corresponding to a scalar product of the form (7).
Let l = dimk and di = dim(mi) (i = 1, 2, 3), and let {e0
i } and {ej
s} be orthogonal bases
of k and mj respectively with respect to B, where 1 ≤i ≤l, j = 1, 2, 3 and 1 ≤s ≤dj.
For any X ∈g \ {0} we write
X =

then System (11) is equivalent to AX = B. Then we have the following:
Proposition 2. Let (G/K, g) be a generalized Wallach space, where the metric g is
determined by the scalar product (7). Then for any aj (j = 1, . . . , d1), bk (k = 1, . . . , d2)
and cs (s = 1, . . . , d3) not all equal to zero, (G/K, g) is a g.o. space if and only if
rank(A) = rank(A, B).
Proof. By Propostion 1 and Corollary 1 it follows that (G/K, g) is a g.o. space if and
only if for any X ∈m \ {0} there exists an a(X) such that the curve expt(a(X) +
X) · o (t ∈R) is a geodesic. This means that System (11) of d1 + d2 + d3 equations
for the variables xi (i = 1, . . . , l) has real solutions for any aj, bk, cs (j = 1, . . . , d1, k =
1, . . . , d2, s = 1, . . . , d3) not all equal to zero. Then system AX = B has real solutions
if and only if rank(A) = rank(A, B).
□
Next, we shall investigate which of the families of spaces listed in Theorem 1 are g.o.
spaces.
Theorem 2. Let (G/K, g) be a generalized Wallach space as listed in Theorem 1. Then
1) If (G/K, g) is a space of type 1) then this is a g.o. space for any Ad(K)-invariant
Riemannian metric.

2) If (G/K, g) is a space of type 2) or 3) then this is a g.o. space if and only if g
is the standard metric.
Proof. 1) In this case it is [ijk] = 0 for all i, j, k, therefore B([ei
α, ej
β], ek
γ) = 0 for any
i, j, k and α, β, γ. So for any Ad(K)-invariant Riemannian metric (λ1, λ2, λ3) and any
non zero vector X ∈m \ {0}, system (11) for the variables xi (i = 1, . . . , l) has real
solutions, hence (G/K, g) is a g.o. space.
2) The only non zero [ijk] is [123] (cf. [22]), so B([e1
α, e2
β], e3
γ) ̸= 0 for some α, β, γ.
Let (λ1, λ2, λ3) be a g.o. metric, that is the generalized Wallach space is a g.o. space.
Then for any non zero vector X ∈m, there exists a(X), such that X + a(X) is a
geodesic vector.
We assume that X ∈m1 ⊕m2. Then in system (11) all c1, c2, . . . , cd3 are zero, hence
it follows that

Then it is rank(A) = rank(A, B) for any aj, bk (j = 1, . . . , d1, k = 1, . . . , d2) not all

We now assume that X ∈m1 ⊕m3. Then in system (11) all b1, b2, . . . , bd3 are zero,
hence we obtain that

Therefore, rank(A) = rank(A, B) for any aj, cs (j = 1, . . . , d1, s = 1, . . . , d3, ) not
all equal to zero, if and only if λ1 = λ3. We conclude that the generalized Wallach
spaces of types 2), 3) in Theorem 1 are g.o. spaces, if and only if the metric (λ1, λ2, λ3)
satisﬁes λ1 = λ2 = λ3.

4. Homogeneous geodesics in generalized Wallach spaces
Let (G/K, g) be a generalized Wallach space with B-orthogonal decomposition g =
k ⊕m, where m = m1 ⊕m2 ⊕m3 and B = −Killing form on g. Let {e0
i } and {ej
s} be
the orthogonal bases of k and mj respectively with respect to B (1 ≤i ≤l, j = 1, 2, 3,
1 ≤s ≤dj). For any X ∈g \ {0} we write
X =

xi, aj, bk, cs ∈R.
In order to ﬁnd all homogeneous geodesics in G/K, it suﬃces to ﬁnd all the real
solutions of system (11), of d1+d2+d3 quadratic equations for the variables xi, aj, bk, cs,
which are not all equal to zero.
By Theorem 2 we only consider homogeneous geodesics in generalized Wallach spaces
types 2) and 3) given in Theorem 1 for the metric (λ1, λ2, λ3), where at least two of
λ1, λ2, λ3 are diﬀerent.
Then the geodesic vectors correspond to those solutions of
system (11) for the variables xi, aj, bk, cs, which are not all equal to zero. However, for
many generalized Wallach spaces it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd all the real solutions of system
(11).
Next, we will give two examples of generalized Wallach spaces and give all the ho-
mogeneous geodesics for any given metric.

HOMOGENEOUS GEODESICS IN GENERALIZED WALLACH SPACES
9
Example 1. We consider the generalized Wallach space SU(2)/{e}.
Let {√−1hα, Aα
√
2, Bα
√
2} be an orthogonal basis of su(2) with respect to B, where α
denotes a simple root of the Lie algebra su(2), and Aα = Eα −E−α, Bα = √−1(Eα +
E−α). Here {Eα} denotes the Weyl basis of su(2). We set Xα = Aα
√
2, Yα = Bα
√
2. Then
we have that
[
√
−1hα, Xα] = α(hα)Yα = Yα,
[
√
−1hα, Yα] = −α(hα)Xα = −Xα,
[Xα, Yα] =
√
−1hα.
The Lie algebra su(2) has an orthogonal decomposition su(2) = m1 ⊕m2 ⊕m3, where
m1, m2, m3 are spanned by √−1hα, Xα and Yα respectively. For any X ∈su(2) we write
X = a
√
−1hα + bXα + cYα,
a, b, c ∈R.
We will ﬁnd all geodesic vectors of SU(2)/{e} for a given metric (λ1, λ2, λ3). System
(11) for SU(2)/{e} is





bc(λ3 −λ2) = 0
ac(λ3 −λ1) = 0
ab(λ2 −λ1) = 0.
(12)
Case 1. λ1 = λ2 ̸= λ3. The solutions of the system (12) are c = 0 or c ̸= 0, a = b = 0,
so the geodesic vectors are X = a√−1hα + bXα and X = cYα.
Case 2. λ1 = λ3 ̸= λ2. The solutions of the system (12) are b = 0 or b ̸= 0, a = c = 0,
so the geodesic vectors are X = a√−1hα + cYα and X = bXα.
Case 3. λ2 = λ3 ̸= λ1. The solutions of the system (12) are a = 0 or a ̸= 0, b = c = 0,
so the geodesic vectors are X = bXα + cYα and X = a√−1hα.
Case 4. λ1, λ2, λ3 are distinct. Then system (12) reduces to ab = ac = bc = 0, whose
solutions are a = b = 0 or a = c = 0 or b = c = 0. In this case any vector X ∈mi\{0}
(i = 1, 2, 3) is a geodesic vector.
Therefore we obtain the following theorem, which recovers a result on R.A. Marinosci
[21, p. 266]
Proposition 3. For the generalized Wallach space SU(2)/{e} the only geodesic vectors
for a given metric (λ1, λ2, λ3) are the following:
1) If λi = λj ̸= λk (i, j, k ∈{1, 2, 3}), then any vector X ∈mk\{0} or X ∈(mi ⊕
mj)\{0}.
2) If λ1, λ2, λ3 are distinct, then any vector X ∈m1 ∪m2 ∪m3.
Example 2. We consider the generalized Wallach space SO(n)/SO(n −2), (n ≥4).
This is the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal 2-frames in Rn. Let so(n) and so(n −2)
be the Lie algebras of SO(n) and SO(n −2) respectively. Let Eab denote the n × n
matrix with 1 in the (ab)-entry and 0 elsewhere.
If eab = Eab −Eba, then the set
B = {eij = Eij −Eji : 1 ≤i < j ≤n} is a B-orthogonal basis of so(n).
The
multiplication table of the elements in B is given as follows:
Lemma 2. If all four indices are distinct, then the Lie brackets in B are zero. Other-
wise, it is [eij, ejk] = eik, where i, j, k are distinct.

ANDREAS ARVANITOYEORGOS AND YU WANG
Let so(n) = k ⊕m1 ⊕m2 ⊕m3 be an orthogonal decomposition of so(n) with respect
to B, where k = spanR{eij : 3 ≤i < j ≤n}, m1 = spanR{e12}, m2 = spanR{e1j : 3 ≤
j ≤n}, and m3 = spanR{e2j : 3 ≤j ≤n}. For any X ∈so(n) we write
X =

aijeij + a12e12 +
X
3≤j≤n
a1je1j +
X
3≤j≤n

aij ∈R.
Then system (11) for SO(n)/SO(n −2) takes the form

(14)
In order to ﬁnd all geodesic vectors in the generalized Wallach space SO(4)/SO(2)
for a given metric, we should ﬁnd all the non zero real solutions of the system (14).
