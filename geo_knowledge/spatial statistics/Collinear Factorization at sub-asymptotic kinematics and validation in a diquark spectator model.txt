We revisit the derivation of collinear factorization for Deep Inelastic Scattering at sub-asymptotic
values of the four momentum transfer squared, where the masses of the particles participating in the
interaction cannot be neglected. By using an inclusive jet function to describe the scattered quark
ﬁnal state, we can restrict the needed parton kinematic approximations just to the four-momentum
conservation of the hard scattering process, and explicitly expand the rest of the diagram in powers
of the unobserved parton transverse momenta rather than neglecting those. This procedure provides
one with more ﬂexibility in ﬁxing the virtuality of the scattered and recoiling partons than in the
standard derivation, and naturally leads to scaling variables that more faithfully represent the
partonic kinematic at sub-asymptotic energy than the Bjorken’s xB variable.
We then verify the validity of the obtained factorization formula by considering a diquark spec-
tator model designed to reproduce the main features of electron-proton scattering at large xB in
Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In the model, the Deep Inelastic Scattering contribution to the cross
section can be explicitly isolated and analytically calculated, then compared to the factorized ap-
proximation. Limiting ourselves to the leading twist contribution, we then show that use of the new
scaling variables maximizes the kinematic range of validity of collinear factorization, and highlight
the intrinsic limitations of this approach due to the unavoidably approximate treatment of four
momentum conservation in factorized diagrams. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss how these limitations
may be overcome by including higher-twist corrections to the factorized calculation.

INTRODUCTION
A.
Motivation
Unraveling the quark and gluon structure of the nucleon still remains a major challenge in hadronic and particle
physics, notwithstanding the signiﬁcant experimental and theoretical advances made in this area throughout the last
decade [1–5].
The Large Hadron Collider can measure a large variety of observables, especially at the energy frontier, and access
the proton structure at the smallest spatial scales. However utilizing its data remains challenging due to tensions
between various observables, and its impact on the determination of unpolarized Parton Distribution Functions
(PDFs) is so far somewhat statistically limited [6–8]. Proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) provide complementary access to PDFs at lower energy scale and higher parton fractional momentum, most
notably in polarized collisions [9–11]. Use of RHIC data in unpolarized PDF ﬁts has however not received much
attention until very recently, despite its potential for ﬂavor separation of sea quarks via weak boson production data
[12, 13] and gluon PDF determination through jet observables. Lowering the collision energy and changing reaction
to electron-proton collisions, recent data from the Jeﬀerson Lab 6 GeV program and those being collected at its 12
GeV upgrade [14, 15], as well as those expected from the future Electron Ion Collider [16, 17] will enable us to access
quarks and gluons in unprecedented ways, and to build an accurate, 3-dimensional picture of the inner structure of
the proton.
In order to use high-energy scattering data to describe the proton’s structure in terms of quark and gluon PDFs
one relies on QCD factorization theorems, such as Collinear Factorization (CF) [18]. These theorems allow one to
write the cross sections of large momentum transfer scattering processes such as Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) as
a convolution of a short distance matrix element, which can be computed perturbatively and describes the quark
and gluon “hard” interaction with a probe, and long distance non perturbative matrix elements – the PDFs – that
describe the quark and gluon momentum distribution within the proton.
In this paper we are interested in assessing the viability of Collinear Factorization in describing DIS events with
large enough 4-momentum transfer to justify a perturbative QCD analysis of the cross sections in terms of quark and
gluon interactions, but not large enough to neglect any other mass or dynamical momentum scale characterizing the
process. For example, experiments at Jeﬀerson Lab with a 6 GeV energy beam involve low photon virtualities Q2 that
require control of 1/Q2 power corrections to the calculation of cross sections. With the 12 GeV beam the accessible Q2
increases, without, however, reaching asymptotic values where other scales can be neglected. In this sub-asymptotic
regime, the mass of the proton target and the mass of an observed hadron, collectively denoted by µ, induce ﬁnite-Q2
corrections of order µ2/Q2 which we call “Hadron Mass Corrections” (HMCs). These can compete with experimental
uncertainties at Jeﬀerson Lab energy and can also aﬀect higher-energy experiments such as HERMES and COMPASS,
see Refs. [19–22]. These papers take into account into account the mass of the target and of the observed hadron
through a rescaling of the Bjorken variable xB, as already discussed for example in [23–25]1. Refs. [19–21] go a step
further, and argue that one also needs to take into account the fact that the (unobserved) scattered parton needs
to have a virtuality substantially diﬀerent from 0 in order to fragment into a massive hadron, and show that this
requirement can be implemented in a gauge invariant way through a modiﬁed scaling variable. Numerical estimates
at JLab kinematics suggest large eﬀects for semi-inclusive pion production [19], and even more for kaons or heavier
hadrons [20]. In fact, HMCs implemented in this way may even explain [21] the apparent large discrepancy between
the measurements of transverse momentum integrated kaon multiplicities performed at HERMES [34] and COMPASS
[35, 36].
Two subsequent papers from the COMPASS collaboration have furthermore analyzed kaons and protons produced at
even larger hadron momentum fractions than reported before, highlighting strong departures from pQCD calculations
[37, 38]. This discrepancy between theory and experiment seems too large to be only due to the phase space limitations
induced by ﬁnite mass eﬀects (which, as argued in Refs. [20, 21], can be treated as a correction to the usual collinear
pQCD calculations) and may indicate that the factorization formalism is being applied in a kinematic region where this
is not a good approximation to the semi-inclusive cross section. If the correct treatment of the partonic kinematics
and the very validity of QCD factorization are under question at high-energy experiments such as HERMES and
COMPASS – and already for transverse momentum integrated observables!
– investigating these issues becomes
essential for a correct interpretation of the upcoming semi-inclusive measurements at the JLab 12 GeV upgraded
facility [14, 15], that are largely focused on the 3D imaging of nucleons and nuclei. Indeed, the transverse momentum

operator product expansion (OPE) formalism [27, 28], and by Ellis, Furmanski and Petronzio in collinear factorization [29]; see [30] for
a review, and [31] for a comparison of mass corrections methods. See also Refs [32, 33] for recent proposals to address the “threshold”
problem within collinear and OPE approaches to target mass corrections.

dependent cross sections are naturally more sensitive to HMCs than their integrated counterparts, and factorization
encounters novel challenges of its own [22, 39–41].
Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we revisit the “standard” derivation of collinear factorization in
DIS processes [42, 43] with the goal of identifying under what conditions this can be extended to the sub-asymptotic
kinematic region, and how one can maximize its regime of applicability. As a ﬁrst step, we will discuss inclusive DIS
scattering, where we can avoid purely technical complications due to the interplay of initial and ﬁnal state kinematics
[20], and limit ourselves to Leading-Order (LO) perturbative calculations, that do not require renormalization of the
quark ﬁelds and limit the ﬁnal state to 2 particles. Nonetheless, we will be able to address in full the need for, and
means of, an improved kinematic approximation. The use of an inclusive jet function [32, 44–46] to describe the
scattered quark ﬁnal state will prove essential to our goals. We will then validate the obtained factorization formula
in the framework of a QCD-like idealized ﬁeld-theoretical model describing a spin 1/2 idealized nucleon, which
contains an active quark as well as a scalar diquark spectator that does not participate in the interaction [47, 48],
and complete the analysis presented in Refs. [49, 50]. In the chosen “diquark spectator model”, one can perform
fully analytic calculations of the DIS cross section, as well as collinear factorization with or without HMCs. The
model is designed to reproduce the main feature of the QCD process at large xB, and a comparison of the full and
collinearly factorized cross sections will determine the validity of the proposed HMC scheme, as well as test the limits
of collinear factorization itself. Furthermore, working within an explicit model we will be able to investigate the role
of the parton’s transverse momentum, that is by necessity neglected in the Leading-Twist calculation of the inclusive
DIS cross section, but contributes to Higher-twist (HT) O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2) corrections. As we will very brieﬂy discuss in
the closing section, we believe that an extension of our HMC scheme to Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) – and, in fact,
also to Semi-Inclusive DIS (SIDIS) processes – should not encounter essential diﬃculties.
B.
Paper organization and overview of results
As this paper is quite long, it is worthwhile to provide the readers with an overview of its structure, the philosophy
behind our approach and the novelties compared to the standard derivation, and the main results of each Section,
before delving into the details of calculations and derivations.
In Section II, we discuss our proposal for performing Collinear Factorization of the DIS structure functions at
sub-asymptotic hard scales Q2, and how one can account for hadron masses and non-zero parton virtualities in the
treatment of partonic kinematics.
Our central philosophy, adopted from Ref. [51], is to minimize the number of
uncontrolled approximations needed to achieve the desired factorization formula. In particular, we conﬁne the needed
“pure” kinematic approximations just to the external legs of the partonic hard-scattering, and perform a controlled
“twist” expansion of the rest of the diagram. Gauge invariance is guaranteed by the use of an inclusive quark jet
function [32, 44–46] to describe the scattered quark in the DIS handbag diagram, rather than utilizing an on-shell
quark propagator as in standard derivations [42, 43]. In fact, our calculation parallels the analogous one for single
inclusive hadron production in SIDIS [43, 52], and highlights how the parton’s transverse momentum needs not be
altogether neglected, but can be instead dynamically included in higher-twist terms [29, 53].
The end result is quite simple: at leading twist (LT), the factorized formula for the hadronic tensor, and therefore
for the cross section and its structure functions, are given by their asymptotic (or massless) counterparts evaluated
at a suitably deﬁned scaling variable ¯x instead of xB, see Eqs. (29)-(33). The choice of the ¯x scaling variable is not
prescribed by the factorization procedure itself, but can be guided by kinematic consideration at the parton level and
by respect of momentum and baryon number conservation laws, see Section II E and in particular Eq. (42).
The use of a scaling variable is not a new concept, as it has been proposed in a similar context, for example, in
Refs. [23, 24, 48, 54, 55] and even earlier in Refs. [26, 27, 29, 56]. Here we attempt, however, at a more systematic
treatment that avoids a priori parton model considerations. In fact our end result cannot be interpreted in parton
model terms except in a well deﬁned limit, but, conversely, gives one enhanced freedom in devising realistic kinematic
approximations in the sub-asymptotic regime. In particular, it turns out that the light-cone virtualities v2 and v ′ 2
of the partons participating in the initial and ﬁnal state of hard-scattering process need not be approximated to zero,
and can be chosen diﬀerently for the incoming and scattered quarks without breaking gauge invariance. This added
ﬂexibility may also facilitate the study of the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative degrees of freedom in
data beyond the deep inelastic regime, where the virtual photon excites proton resonances [57] and may be sensitive
to multi-parton nucleon substructures [58].
The theoretical results outlined above are compelling, but call for a benchmark validation. To this end, in Section III
we present the diquark spectator model adopted for our validation study, and use this to analytically calculate the
inelastic lepton-proton cross section at LO. We then show how the cross section can be decomposed in a gauge
invariant way into DIS, proton resonance, and interference contributions, and study in detail the proton’s FT and FL
transverse and longitudinal structure functions, as well as their scaling properties with respect to the photon virtuality

Q2. The low-xB behavior of the model also turns out to be interesting, even if the model is not designed to provide
one with a realistic description of experimental measurements in that regime. Indeed, our explicit calculation will
highlight a quite diﬀerent Q2 scaling of the DIS component of FL compared to simple dimensional arguments and to
what happens for FT . As we will explain, this is however a general consequence of gauge invariance rather than a
model artifact. It may also explain the need for phenomenological O(1/Q2) corrections in order for CF calculation of
FL to agree with recent HERA data at small values of the Bjorken invariant xB [59].
Sections (IV) and (V) are devoted to the validation of the sub-asymptotic factorization formulae 29-33 for the DIS
transverse structure function F DIS
T
. The goal is to verify: (i) to what extent the ”internal” (i.e., unobserved) partonic
variables can be replaced in the factorized cross section by the proposed sub-asymptotic kinematic approximations
and the use of a scaling variable; (ii) how large transverse momentum corrections of order O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2), with k 2
T
the parton’s transverse momentum, are since these cannot be kinematically included in the scaling variables and
dynamically contribute to the factorized cross section starting only at next-to-leading twist; and (iii) explore the
intrinsic limitations of collinear factorization. The conclusions we will reach are rather robust versus variations of
model parameters, as demonstrated in the Appendix, and therefore indicative of what we may expect to happen in
QCD.
In Section IV, the accuracy to which the ¯x scaling variable describes the internal partonic kinematics is investigated,
and this and the corresponding light-cone virtuality ¯v are compared to the average parton momentum fraction and
virtuality values calculated in the full model. In particular, we ﬁnd that one can approximate at the 90% level the
average parton fractional momentum by including all external mass scales in the quark-mass-corrected Nachtmann
scaling variable ξq = ξ(1 + m2
q/Q2), where mq is the quark mass and the Nachtmann variable ξ [26] accounts for the
proton mass; small corrections of order O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2) account for the rest.
These conclusions are conﬁrmed in Section V, where we compare the full and factorized transverse FT structure
functions and show that only corrections of order O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2) are needed to describe the full structure functions after
removing all mass corrections by using of the ξq in our sub-asymptotic CF formula. These additional corrections are
not experimentally controllable in inclusive measurements, but given their small size one can hope to theoretically treat
them in the twist expansion [29, 53] without resorting to the Transverse-Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization
formalism [42, 52], or phenomenologically by adding a power suppressed term to a PDF ﬁt analysis. A brief discussion
of these issues is oﬀered in Section VI, and a detailed analysis is left for future work.
In Section V we also demonstrate the inherent limits of collinear factorization, that breaks down at very large xB
because the kinematical approximations needed to factorize the PDFs and the partonic hard scattering coeﬃcient
do not respect four momentum conservation in transverse momentum, as already argued in Ref. [48]. Fortunately,
this eﬀect can be circumscribed by simple kinematic cuts on the invariant mass W of the ﬁnal state, and our model
estimate indicates that factorization breaks down only in the resonance region at W 2 ≲4 GeV2.
Finally, in Section VII we summarize the many results of our paper and their implications, and in the Appendices
we included a study of the dependence (or rather independence) of our conclusions on the model parameters. In
the Appendix section, we also provide: a complete discussion of the structure function projectors and their small-xB
limit; details of the sub-asymptotic kinematic limits; an analytic calculation of the small-xB scaling behaviour of the
model structure functions; and an explicit illustration of resonant electron-nucleon scattering when the masses of the
constituents are smaller than the mass of the target itself.
II.
COLLINEAR FACTORIZATION AT SUB-ASYMPTOTIC MOMENTUM TRANSFER
Deeply inclusive lepton-nucleon scattering on a proton or neutron target is illustrated in Figure 1, where the incident
lepton (with four-momentum momentum l) interacts with a nucleon (p) through the exchange of a virtual photon
(q). At large values of the virtuality Q2 = −qµqµ, the virtual photon scatters, on a short time scale, on a quark of
four momentum k belonging to the nucleon. In the ﬁnal state, one measures the recoil lepton momentum l′, while
the recoiled quark with four momentum k′, as well as the remnant X of the proton are unobserved. The remnant
is a system of many particles produced by the fragmentation of the target after the photon extracted one of its
quarks. In fact, the colored quark and remnant are subject to QCD conﬁnement, and, on a much longer time scale
compared to the photon-quark scattering process, hadronize into a system of color neutral hadrons. Far from kinematic
thresholds, unitarity arguments show that color neutralization can be ignored in an inclusive measurement such as we
are discussing, and the process calculated as if quarks where asymptotic states, see the left panel of Figure 1. However,
closer to the pion production threshold the ﬁnal state phase space shrinks, and one needs to take into account the fact
that on-shell quarks cannot be present in the ﬁnal state. In this regime, it is possible to consider the diagram on the
right panel of Figure 1 where one includes a quark remnant Y to account for quark hadronization. Note that we are
considering diagrams in which the ﬁnal state in the current direction, Y , does not interact with the target remnant
X. This assumption is indeed justiﬁed at large enough values of the Bjorken invariant xB = Q2/2(pµqµ), which is the

focus of this paper, because the ﬁnite value ﬁnal state invariant mass W 2 = (1 −1/xB)Q2 + M 2 kinematically limits
the transverse momentum of particles produced in the quark’s direction, squeezing these in a jet-like conﬁguration
aligned with the quark’s momentum [60, 61].
A.
Kinematics
We parametrize the four-momenta of the proton, photon and incoming quark in Figure 1 in terms of light-cone unit
vectors n and n, which satisfy n2 = n2 = 0 and n · n = 1 [29]. The “plus” and “minus” components of a four-vector
aµ are deﬁned by a+ = a · n = (a0 + az)/
√
2 and a−= a · n = (a0 −az)/
√
2. Then, one can decompose
aµ = a+nµ + a−nµ + a µ
T ≡(a+, a−, aT ),
(1)
where aµ
T is the vector’s transverse four-momentum, which satisﬁes aT · n = aT · n = 0, with norm a2
T = −a 2
T , and
aT ≡(aT x, aT y) is the 2D Euclidean transverse momentum.
We will work in the “(p, q) frames” class [19], in which the initial proton momentum and virtual photon are collinear
in 3-dimensional space and oriented along the z−direction. We can thus decompose them as
pµ = p+ nµ + M 2
2p+ nµ,
(2)
qµ = −ξp+ nµ + Q2
2ξp+ nµ,
(3)
where ξ is the so-called Nachtmann variable and is deﬁned as
ξ ≡−q+
p+ =
2xB

BM 2/Q2 .
(4)
The p+ component of the nucleon’s momentum parametrizes the Lorentz boosts in the z direction, and interpolates
between the nucleon rest frame (p+ = M/
√
2) and the inﬁnite momentum frame (p+ →∞). The use of a light-
cone reference frame is justiﬁed for hard scattering at large Q2, where the proton and scattered quark momenta are
dominated by their light-cone plus and minus components, respectively. For the same reason, this is also the frame
used to perform collinear factorization, as discussed more extensively in the rest of this section.
Both the target momentum p and the photon momentum q are “external” variables, namely they are experimentally
measured in the process of interest.
On the contrary, the incoming and outgoing quark momenta are not even
in principle measurable and therefore we will consider them “internal” variables.
The parton momenta can be

where x ≡k+
p+ is the light cone momentum fraction carried by the parton. In Eq. (5), the struck quark’s “light-cone
virtuality”
v2 = k2 + k 2
T
(7)
is a mass scale that will be relevant to our derivation of sub-asymptotic collinear factorization. The name is justiﬁed by
noticing that k−= v2/(2k+), so that v2 quantiﬁes how far the quark momentum is from the light-cone plus direction.
As we will discuss, it is this scale, rather than the quark’s virtuality k2 alone, that controls the partonic kinematics in
the diagram and determines the applicability of collinear factorization assumptions. Similarly, the outgoing quark’s
light-cone virtuality, v ′ 2, is deﬁned as
v ′ 2 = k′2 + k′ 2
T .

B.
The DIS hadronic tensor at LO
The diﬀerential cross section for the inelastic scattering of an unpolarized lepton from an unpolarized nucleon target
can be written in the Born approximation as
dσ
dxBdQ2 = πα2y2
Q6
Lµν 2MW µν ,
(9)
where α = e2
4π is the ﬁne structure constant, Q2 = −q · q is the photon’s virtuality, xB = Q2/(2p · q) is the Bjorken
variable, and the Lorentz invariant y is deﬁned as y = p·l
p·q (here and in the following we use the shorthand a·b ≡aµbµ for
the Lorentz contraction of 2 four-vectors). The leptonic Lµν tensor for unpolarized leptons can be directly computed
from QED and reads,
Lµν(l, l′) = 2(lµl′
ν + lνl′
µ −l · l′gµν) .
(10)
The hadronic tensor W µν, on the other hand, is an inclusive tensor containing all the information on the structure of
the nucleon target. It is deﬁned by summing the transition matrix elements of the electromagnetic current operator
Jµ between the initial state nucleon and all possible unobserved ﬁnal states X,

where we have used the shorthand notation d3pX /(2π)32EX = Q
i∈X d3pi/(2π)32Ei, with pX the total momentum of
the unobserved hadrons. For a derivation of these formulae, see for example Ref. [43] and the works cited therein.
We now wish to factorize the hadronic tensor in terms of a non-perturbative quark distribution function q(x), and
a perturbatively calculable photon-quark hard scattering term Hµν, without relying on the assumption that Q2 is
asymptotically large - as done in most derivations, see for example [42] - but still assuming that this is large enough
to resolve individual quarks within the target.
Working at LO in the coupling constant, we consider the DIS handbag diagram shown in Figure 2, where we have
included the customary quark correlator Φ(p, k) in the bottom part [42], and an “inclusive quark jet correlator” Ξ(k′)
in the top part [42, 45, 46, 62]. In the context of collinear factorization, the quark jet correlator was already used
in Ref [32, 48, 51] in order to correctly handle the external, hadron-level kinematic constraints in the DIS endpoint
region, while allowing one to perform the parton-level momentum approximations needed to prove the factorizability
of the DIS hadronic tensor. As a ﬁeld theoretical object in its own right, the quark jet correlator has also been
recently studied in Refs. [45, 46], where it was used to derive a complete set of fragmentation function sum rules and
to provide a new way to study the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. In our derivation of factorization,
we will incorporate insights from that analysis. In fact, using the jet correlator, we will be able to weaken the needed
approximations on the quark’s transverse momentum compared to other collinear factorization derivations [42, 48].

(14)
where |Ω⟩is the interacting vacuum state, and can be interpreted as the discontinuity of the quark propagator [45, 46].
For simplicity, we work in light-cone gauge and therefore we can ignore the Wilson lines in the deﬁnition of either Φ
or Ξ. Nonetheless, the sub-asymptotic kinematic assumptions we consider will only be made at the hard-scattering
vertex, and will not change the derivation of the Wilson lines in QCD. Therefore, the results obtained in this work
can be extended to any gauge.
C.
Factorization at asymptotic Q2
We start the discussion on factorization, by reviewing the approximations taken in standard Collinear Factorization
derivations, performed in the Bjorken limit at asymptotically high values of Q2 [42, 43, 48].
This will help us
understanding where the assumption can be weakened if one wants to extend the procedure to sub-asymptotic values
of the scale.
First of all, since the ﬁnal state invariant mass is large, one can sum Eq. (11) over a complete set of states X
replacing the jet correlator with a single quark line that passes the cut and can be considered a particle of zero mass2:
Ξ(k) −→k/′δ(k′2) .

q ≪Q2 and quarks can indeed be considered massless. However, this is not strictly necessary, and one can treat the

q/Q2 limit independently of the Bjorken limit. Hence the quark mass can be retained in the δ function, see for example
Ref. [48].

If one also immediately integrates over d4k′, this turns into (k/ + q/) δ
 (k + q)2
. We have thus arrived at the starting
point of most standard CF derivations, which is only valid if one assumes asymptotic values of Q2 from the outset
[42].
Next, in order to decouple the hard scattering from the soft quark dynamics in the target, one needs a suitable set
of kinematic approximations on the subleading components of the unobserved initial state quark momentum k. For
an inclusive DIS cross section the goal is to reduce the remaining 4-dimensional integral over k to a 1-dimensional
integral over the dominant k+ ∼Q component. This can be done in two independent steps. Firstly, one can neglect
the quark’s transverse momentum and assume that kT ≈0. In other words, the incoming quark’s 3-momentum
is assumed to be parallel, or “collinear” to the 3-momentum of the target’s nucleon . This “collinear (kinematic)
approximation” is certainly a valid approximation at asymptotic Q2 values because |kT | ∼ΛQCD.
Secondly, in
order to preserve gauge invariance at the hard scattering vertex, one also needs to assume that k−≈0, i.e., to also
consider the scattering quark to be on-shell with mq = 0. This is a justiﬁed kinematic approximation, as well, since
k−∼Λ2
QCD/Q, and moreover agrees with the intuitive DIS picture provided by Feynman’s parton model [63, 64]. We
stress, nonetheless, that any assumption about the virtuality of the quark is in addition to its being or not collinear
in 3-dimensional space to its parent hadron3.
Finally, applying the collinear approximation and setting mq = 0, one ﬁnds Φ(k) ≈k+γ−and the hadronic tensor
can be written as a 1-dimensional convolution:

is the quark’s light-cone plus momentum distribution, usually called “collinear” quark PDF. As discussed above,
this name involves a mild abuse of language, the essential feature being that it provides a 1-dimensional momentum
distribution, integrated over the transverse and light-cone minus components. The rest of the integrand, enclosed in
curly brackets, can be interpreted as the tensor describing the scattering of a virtual photon with a massless quark
traveling in the direction of its parent hadron (i.e., a “collinear” parton) and Eq. (16) provides one with a ﬁeld-
theoretical realization of Feynman’s parton model – or, more accurately, it shows how the parton model emerges in
the large Q2 limit of QCD calculations.
D.
Factorization at ﬁnite Q2
At sub-asymptotic values of Q2, we need to be more careful with the kinematic approximations since now have to
deal with a set of hadrons in the ﬁnal state’s current region rather than a single on-shell quark. We then go back
to the starting point, Eq. (12), before integrating over k′ at variance with what did in the previous subsection. In
this, we proceed similarly to derivations of factorization in SIDIS processes [43], which we take as a template for our
derivation.
Since neither the k nor k′ momenta are directly measurable, see Fig. 2, we treat them as internal variables. We
then need to approximate both the scattering and recoiled k and k′ quark momenta appearing in the 4-momentum
conservation δ-function. Namely, we take
δ(4)(k + q −k′) ≃δ(4)(ek + q −ek′) ,
(18)
with ek and ek′ deﬁned as,

and the approximate light cone ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 virtualities ideally chosen such that they approximate the respective
averages, ¯v 2 ≈⟨v2⟩= ⟨k2 + k 2
T ⟩and ¯v ′ 2 ≈⟨v ′ 2⟩= ⟨k′2 + k′ 2
T ⟩. Note, that we are approximating only the sub-sub-
leading momentum components of the scattering and recoiled partonic momenta, but we fully retain their individual
transverse components.
In this respect, we depart from the treatment of Refs [42, 48], and do not need further
kinematic assumptions.
Before carrying on with the derivation, it is important to remark that the approximation (18) is only made at the
hard scattering vertex level, denoted with red circles in Figure 2, and that this is the only approximation we perform4.
Next, instead of neglecting the transverse momenta as in the standard derivation, we will perform a twist expansion
of the nonperturbative correlators, and only then we integrate over the transverse transverse momenta. Finally (as
in the standard derivation) we will obtain the hadronic tensor written as a 1-dimensional integral over the light-cone
plus direction. In this sense, with a mild abuse of language as also discussed in the previous subsection, the factorized
result can still be considered “collinear”.
We can now carry on. In the approximated delta function (18), the light-cone k+ and k′−momentum components
decouple from the transverse momenta,

and the integrations over dk−and dk′ + in Eq. (12) can act directly on Φ(k) and Ξ(k′). Therefore, by deﬁning the
Transverse-Momentum Dependent (TMD) quark correlator as

Note that we have written the integral over dk+ in terms of dx, and that the integration over d2k′
T has set k′
T = kT .
The remaining d2kT
transverse momentum integration acts only over the trace term, and the plus- and minus-
direction delta functions ﬁx the values of the light cone fraction x and of the dominant k′−component of the
recoiled quark momentum, respectively. One can here appreciate the importance of approximating the quark light-
cone virtualities rather than their mass in Eqs. (19)-(20): in that case, we would be able to achieve delta function
transverse decoupling only if we also approximated to zero the quark transverse momenta. As it will become clear by
the end of this subsection, this additional approximation on kT is not necessary to achieve factorization.
We still need to decouple the quark and jet correlators in the trace appearing in Eq. (24). To this end, we introduce
the “operational” twist expansion [43, 66] for the TMD correlators, Φ(x, kT ) and J(k′−, k′
T ). As with the kinematic
approximations discussed above, this dynamical expansion is predicated on the existence of a hard scale determining a
large boost in the light cone direction such that the scattering quark momentum component satisfy k+ ≫|kT | ≫k−,
and for the recoiled momentum k′−≫|k′
T | ≫k′+. In DIS, such a scale is provided by the photon’s virtuality Q2,
and one can consider p+ ∼k′−∼Q. The quark correlator can then be expressed as a power expansion in M/p+,
where the power counting scale M can be identiﬁed with the proton mass [52]. Limiting ourselves to the unpolarized
sector, we write

where q(x, k 2

T ) are twist-3
level parton distributions. The latter describes the non-perturbative dynamics of the quark’s intrinsic transverse mo-
mentum. For the TMD inclusive jet correlator, the power counting scale can be identiﬁed with the ΛQCD conﬁnement
4 As already stressed in Refs. [51] and [42], working locally at the level of the hard scattering vertex instead of globally at the level of the
whole Feynman diagram provides one with ﬂexibility to adjust the kinematic approximation to the situation under discussion. In this
paper we exploit this ﬂexibility to address the factorization of DIS at sub-asymptotic Q2 values, and we make our approximations very
explicit as recommended by Ref. [42].

The leading twist coeﬃcient α(k′−) = θ(k−)

T , is the analog of the unpolarized D1 fragmentation
function in SIDIS [52] but integrated over the detected hadron momentum, and summed over all hadron ﬂavors (indeed
we are considering inclusive DIS events, where the ﬁnal state remains undetected). The chiral-odd twist-3 coeﬃcient
ζ(k′−) = θ(k−)
2(2π)3 Mj/ΛQCD is also independent of k′
T , and Mj = mq +mcorr includes perturbative and non-perturbative
“jet mass” contributions [46, 61]; it is the analog of the chiral-odd fragmentation function E [52]. The transverse
momentum thus appears explicitly as a kinematic factor in the twist expansion (26).

the integration over d2kT acts only on the quark distribution and produces the standard collinear PDF

(28)
Gauge invariance is guaranteed by qµTr[ n/ γµ n/ γν] = 0 despite having assumed a diﬀerent light-cone virtuality ¯v 2
and ¯v ′ 2 for the scattering and recoiled partons. This result is only possible thanks to the twist expansion of the jet
correlator, introduced in the handbag diagram instead of a single ﬁnal-state quark line, and clearly goes beyond a
naive parton-model treatment of the process.
At twist-4, we ﬁnd a contribution from the collinear e(x) ≡

One can thus explicitly see that the dynamics of the parton transverse momentum is not neglected in this approach,
but rather included in twist-4 terms. The twist-4 terms appearing in Eq. (27) are, however, not gauge invariant by
themselves. Gauge invariance can nonetheless be restored by properly summing these to contributions stemming from
the inclusion of 4-parton matrix elements in the handbag diagram [29, 53, 67]. This is left for future work.
We would also like to remark that the approach we have followed here is not entirely new.
In fact it closely
corresponds to the treatment of SIDIS cross sections in terms of transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs [43, 52], and
a detailed correspondence can be obtained through the use of the fragmentation function sum rules developed in
[44–46]. The SIDIS formalism is, however, at present fully developed only up to twist-3 level.
Finally, the factorized hadronic tensor at leading-twist (LT) can be written as a convolution of a hard scattering
tensor Hµν and the collinear PDF q(x),

and depends on two mass scales, namely, the approximate incoming and outgoing light cone parton virtualities ¯v 2

E.
Kinematic approximations in QCD
As discussed in Section II D, collinear factorization requires one to approximate the incoming and outgoing quark
light-cone virtualities, namely to take v2 ≈¯v2 and v ′ 2 ≈¯v ′ 2. However, v2 and v ′ 2 are not observable and cannot be
experimentally controlled. One needs therefore to resort to a physically or theoretically motivated Ansatz to choose
suitable ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 values. For this purpose, we will derive kinematic bounds on v2 and v ′ 2 valid at any order in
perturbation theory, and use these to obtain good Ans¨atze for ¯v2 and ¯v ′ 2. We will then test these in Section IV.
1.
Choice of ¯v ′ 2
We start by considering the jet subdiagram on top of Figure 2, in which the struck quark of momentum k′ is
fragmenting in a number of particles. By fermion number conservation, the incoming quark line should also pass the
cut and appear in the ﬁnal state. Thus, by 4-momentum conservation,
v ′ 2 = k′2 + k′ 2
T ≥m2
q + k′ 2
T .
(34)
In fact, the quark needs to fragment into at least one hadron and therefore one should take into account the mass of
the lightest hadron the quark can quark hadronize into, that is, the pion. Hence, a tighter bound is
v ′ 2 ≥m2
π + k′ 2
T .
(35)
We can then use the lower bound as a minimal approximation of the average ⟨v ′ 2⟩. However, in a fully inclusive
scattering, the transverse k′ 2
T momentum cannot be experimentally controlled. Therefore, we choose
¯v ′ 2 = m2
π .
(36)
Note that with this choice we depart from the standard derivations of collinear factorization, where ¯v ′ 2 is approximated
to zero for light quarks. A similar argument for ﬂavor tagged inclusive measurements such as of the charm structure
function F c
2 would lead to ¯v ′ 2 = m2
D ≈m2
c, with mD the D meson mass and mc the c quark mass, and eventually to
scaling variables such as advocated in [23, 55].
As QCD transitions from perturbative to non-perturbative degrees of freedom at large xB it is also possible that the
virtual photon couple not to a single quark but to a composite partonic substructure, and ¯v ′ 2 could also be considered
to be the invariant mass of the latter [58]. Without a speciﬁc model to guide one’s choice, one could treat ¯v ′ 2 as
a phenomenological parameter and determine this for example in a global QCD analysis of inelastic data. However,
large values for this parameter, that Ref. [58] would interpret as evidence for nucleonic substructure, might instead
emerge as the ﬁt eﬀectively subsumes the dynamics of the quark hadronization process or the kinematic shifts induced
by the quark’s transverse momentum into an eﬀective ¯v ′ 2 ≈⟨m2
Y ⟩+ ⟨k 2
T ⟩parameter. We will come back to these
considerations when we discuss the scaling variable ¯x at the end of this subsection.
2.
Choice of ¯v 2
Considering now target fragmentation, i.e., the lower vertex in the DIS diagrams of Figure 1 right we ﬁnd that

Note that the light-cone virtuality vanishes as x →0, and becomes negative as x →1. Imposing baryon number
conservation in the right diagram of Figure 1 requires the presence of at least one baryon in the ﬁnal state. Assuming
the baryon number ﬂows into the target jet, imposes that the remnant X minimally contains a nucleon, p2

v2 ≤−

with the upper bound representing the case in which the target jet is made of just one nucleon. It is then reasonable
to choose
¯v 2 = −x2
1 −xM 2
(40)
as a minimal approximation of the average ⟨v2⟩, where we also neglected the internal variable k 2
T that cannot be
experimentally controlled in inclusive lepton-proton scattering.
A simpliﬁed choice can be obtained by noticing that in Eq. (32), the light-cone fraction ¯x = ξ(1 + ¯v ′ 2/Q2 −
¯v 2¯v ′ 2/Q4) + O(µ6/Q6) depends on ¯v2 only starting at order O(µ4/Q4) and can be approximated in ﬁrst instance as
¯x ≈ξ

. This is equivalent to eﬀectively choosing
¯v 2 = 0
(41)
in Eq. (32). As one can expect from Eq. (38) and we will numerically conﬁrm in our model calculation, this is in fact
a good approximation for ⟨v2⟩at not too large values of xB, and as long as one considers small enough light-cone
virtualities ¯v ′ 2. It is also the approximation taken in the parton model, and in standard derivations of collinear
factorization, where k2 ≈m2
q ≈0 at the same time as kT ≈0.
3.
Light cone fraction ¯x
Having discussed possible choices for Ans¨atze for ¯v2 and ¯v ′ 2, we can focus our attention on the light-cone fraction
¯x derived in Eq. (32).
Far from kinematic thresholds, namely for not too large values of xB, one can choose ¯v 2 = 0 for the scattering
quark, see Eq. (41). Using furthermore ¯v ′ 2 = m2
π from (36) for the recoiling quark, one obtains5

(42)
Note that with a non-zero ¯v ′ 2 like in Eq. (36) we are more closely respecting the internal kinematics of the handbag
diagram than with ¯v ′ 2 = 0.
Therefore, we can expect that ¯x = ξπ will provide a better approximation to the
non-factorized diagram’s than in standard collinear factorization.
At larger values of xB, i.e., closer to the kinematic threshold, the virtuality (38) diverges to minus inﬁnity, and
a diﬀerent approximation may be needed. In this regime, a suitable approximation to v2 that is valid in both the
small-xB and large-xB regimes is
¯v 2(¯x) = −
¯x2
1 −¯xM 2,
(43)
where we replaced x = ¯x in Eq. (38). Substituting Eq. (43) in Eq. (32), solving the resulting equation for ¯x pertur-
batively in powers of µ2/Q2, and ﬁnally setting ¯v ′ 2 = m2

. Note that at small xB the fourth order term quickly vanishes, and one recovers Eq. (42).
Closer to the kinematic threshold, this new scaling variables accounts for the non-vanishing of the scattering quark’s
light-cone virtuality. The latter can be approximated by substituting Eq. (44) back in Eq. (43) we can also obtain an
approximation for quark’s virtuality, and written purely in terms of the external variables:
¯v 2
∗≡¯v 2(ξ∗
π) .
(45)
This is the best approximation to the unobserved scattering parton’s virtuality we can obtain without measuring the
hadronic ﬁnal state. However, as we will verify in Section IV, using Eq. (44) instead of Eq. (42) has little eﬀect on
calculations of the factorized cross section, and Eq. (42) is a suﬃcient approximation.
As already noted earlier, the approximated ¯v ′ 2 virtuality could also be considered as a free parameter and deter-
mined in a PDF ﬁt utilizing ¯x = ξ(1 + ¯v ′ 2/Q2) instead of the prescription (42). The interpretation of the obtained
¯v ′ 2 value, however, may not be straightforward even if found to be substantially larger than m2
π, which is, according
to our analysis, the minimum expected value. On the one hand, Ref. [58] argues that any improvement in the ﬁt
would signal the emergence of composite partonic substructure in the nucleon target. On the other hand, the quark
can in general hadronize to more than one particle and the ﬁtted ¯v ′ 2 can naturally be expected to be larger than m2
π.
Furthermore, even apart from hadronization dynamics considerations, we will show in Section V that an improvement
in the CF description of a DIS structure function can also emerge if the unobserved quark’s transverse momentum is
kinematically accounted for by choosing ¯v ′ 2 = m2
π +⟨k 2
T ⟩, with ⟨k 2
T ⟩a free parameter of O(Λ2
QCD). Thus, large values
of ¯v ′ 2 may not necessarily indicate the presence of nucleon substructures other than asymptotically free partons.
F.
Discussion
Despite its simplicity, formula (30) is non-trivial and it is worthwhile summarizing under what conditions it has
been obtained.
First of all, we emphasize once more that the transverse momentum is not approximated but rather included in
higher-order terms in the twist expansion, which provides a controlled dynamical approximation. In fact, using the
quark ﬁeld’s equation of motion relations, one can show that the twist-3 PDF e can be decomposed as xe = x ee+ mq
M q,
where ee correspond to a “pure” twist-3 dynamical contribution [52]. Similarly, the jet mass can be decomposed as
Mj = mq + mcorr, where mcorr is the dynamical mass of the jet [45, 46]. Thus the twist expansion (27) does not only
provide an expansion in the transverse momentum eﬀects, but also in the quark mass contributions in a way that is
reminiscent of Ref. [68]. The quark mass expansion is appropriate as long as the quarks are light enough, otherwise
one might want to include the term proportional to m2
q in the LT partonic tensor.
The only uncontrolled approximation we have performed is a purely kinematic one. Namely, we have ﬁxed the
value of the quark light-cone virtualities v and v′ of the initial and ﬁnal state quarks, such that their sub-dominant
momentum components are approximated by k−≈¯v 2/2k+ and k′+ ≈¯v ′ 2/2k′−. But, crucially, this approximation
is only taken inside the parton-level 4-momentum conservation delta function, which is part of the “hard scattering”
graphically identiﬁed by red circles in Figure 2. Thus, following the philosophy of [42], we have conﬁned the only
needed non-controlled approximation to the hard interaction and kept the parton momenta otherwise unapproximated.
The price to be paid for this approximation – which is the minimal kinematic approximation compatible with collinear
factorization! – is that transverse momentum conservation in the approximated hadronic tensor is eﬀectively broken,
and this sets an inescapable limit to the validity of the CF formula at large xB [48]. We will numerically study this
limit for the benchmark spectator model in Section V B.
Clearly, Eq. (30) reduces to the parton model result for light quarks in the ¯v 2 →0 and ¯v ′ 2 →0 limit, in which the
partons are taken to approximately travel on the light cone. But even then, the quarks need not be approximately
on their k2 ≈k′2 ≈m2
q ≈0 mass shell, as often stated in literature, unless one further assumes - with no need - that
the quarks are real particles. For generic values of the approximated ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 quark virtualities, a gauge invariant
factorized hadronic tensor can only be obtained if one considers the jet diagram in Figure 2 and its twist expansion.
Had we worked in the parton model from the outset, or even in QCD but with a perturbative quark line instead of a
jet correlator in the top part of the handbag diagram of Figure 2, this would not have been possible.
We have thus found in Eq. (29)-(32) a gauge invariant generalization of the standard collinear factorization procedure
for the hadronic tensor (12), which is now also valid at sub-asymptotic values of Q2 and does not require one to
approximate to zero the virtuality of the scattering and recoiling partons. With this added ﬂexibility, in Section IV
we will study a range of choices for ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 in order to maximally extend the range of validity of the LT factorization
approximation towards large xB and low Q2 values.

proton-quark-diquark vertex, with ultraviolet modes cut oﬀby a suitable form factor. The labels indicate the momenta of
the particles involved in the collision: q is the momentum of the photon; p is the momentum target nucleon; k and k′ are
the momenta of the incoming and scattered quark participating in the hard scattering; pφ is the momentum of the spectator
diquark. The particle masses are also explicitly indicated.

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK: THE DIQUARK SPECTATOR MODEL
As we discussed in Section II, deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering involves the fragmentation of the proton or
neutron target, as illustrated in the left panel of Figure 1. Target fragmentation in QCD is a complex, non-perturbative
process that cannot be computed exactly, as yet. Instead, we wish to mimic this with a suitable proton-quark-meson
vertex in a model theory, where full analytical calculations of the structure functions can be compared to their collinear
approximation and thus validate the sub-asymptotic CF procedure derived in the previous Section.
We then consider an idealized ﬁeld-theoretical model describing an electrically charged spin 1/2 particle of mass M,
that plays the role of a proton and contains a charged active quark of mass mq and a neutral scalar diquark spectator,
φ, of mass mφ [47, 48]. In this model the proton’s remnant X is mimicked by the spectator φ, with mφ of the order of
the average remnant’s invariant mass ⟨mX⟩, and we can simulate e+p collisions by studying the diagram in Figure 3.
For the proton-quark-diquark vertex we choose the following structure:
Y = ig(k2)11 ,
(46)
where g(k2) generically denotes a form factor which takes into account that a diquark is, in fact, a composite ﬁeld.
In this paper, we choose for simplicity the dipolar form factor
g(k2) = g k2 −m2
q
|k2 −Λ2|2 ,
(47)
where g is a dimensionful coupling constant and Λ a parameter. This vertex is infrared safe, and smoothly cuts oﬀ
ultraviolet modes in the quark leg when k2 is much larger than Λ2. This is an eﬀective way of simulating conﬁnement
in the proton target, since the cutoﬀimposes a length scale of order 1/Λ. The strong coupling constant g does not
play a signiﬁcant role in our discussion, and we set this to g = 1 GeV2 for simplicity. The conﬁnement scale Λ and the
spectator mass mφ, are considered free parameters of the model, and are meant to capture the salient non-perturbative
features of the DIS process. Other possible choices of form factor, including an exponential form and a combination
of scalar and axial diquarks to simulate up and down quarks have been discussed in Ref. [47].
The model parameters can be determined by ﬁtting the analytic calculations of parton distribution functions, which
are possible in the model due to the relative simplicity of the vertex, to phenomenological extractions from experimental
data [1, 4]. Here we adopt the values ﬁtted in Ref. [47] to the PDFs determined by the ZEUS collaboration [69],
namely,
mφ = 0.822 GeV,
Λ = 0.609 GeV,
(48)
with quark and proton masses kept ﬁxed at
mq = 0.3 GeV,
M = 0.939 GeV.
(49)
We will use these values as default, but we will also consider variations around these numbers in order to study the
systematics of the sub-asymptotic collinear factorization scheme to be discussed later. We also note that with these
mass parameters, mq + mφ > M and the proton is a stable particle as it happens in QCD.

In this work, we consider mq ̸= 0 in order to study the kinematic dependence of the process on the mass generated
in the ﬁnal state, and how to retain this in the collinear factorization of the DIS cross section. Similar studies for
the inclusive DIS process have been performed in Refs. [23, 54, 55] with a focus on heavy-quark production; for
semi-inclusive DIS in Refs [20, 21], that focused on kinematic corrections induced by the mass of the detected hadron;
and in Ref. [58] with the aim of identifying “clustered” substructures within the target. In all these works, masses
are taken into account by a suitable rescaling of the struck quark’s momentum light-cone fraction x. In this paper,
we revisit the basis for these scaling approximations utilized and test these against the full analytic model calculation
of the process. As in Ref. [48], we will restrict our analysis to light quarks with mass much smaller than the charm’s,
mq ≪mc, and in particular consider values of the order of the strange quark mass, mq ∼ms.
Lastly, we would like to stress that mφ and Λ are “internal”, unobservable parameters of the model, in the same
way that the QCD conﬁnement scale or the remnant mass cannot be directly measured in electron-proton scattering.
Conversely, even in an inclusive measurement, we treat the quark mass as a known “external” parameter. In QCD,
this would be akin to what happens in measurements of the charmed structure function F c
2 in DIS [70, 71], where the
active charm quark can be tagged by identifying a heavy ﬂavor hadron in the hadronic ﬁnal state, without however
measuring its momentum, or the momentum of any other hadron.
A.
Calculation of the hadronic tensor
As opposed to QCD, where the matrix elements in Eq. (11) need to be parametrized because their non-perturbative
nature, in the spectator model the nucleon-quark-diquark vertex is explicitly known, see Eqs. (46) and (47), and
one can analytically compute the hadronic tensor. At leading order in the strong coupling constant, the involved
diagrams are collected in Figure 4. Note that by electric charge conservation, as stressed in Ref. [48], we need not only
to consider the coupling of the photon to the quark, which is expected to dominate at large values of the invariant
mass squared W 2 = (p + q)2, but also the photon-proton coupling. The LO cross section is therefore composed of
3 physical process that are observationally indistinguishable but theoretically separable, as we will discuss in the
next subsection. The ﬁrst one is photon-quark scattering, and mimics deeply inelastic scattering on the proton, see
Figure 4(a). The second one is the photo-induced excitation of the proton, that subsequently decays into into a quark
and a diquark, see Figure 4(c). This is akin to resonance excitation and subsequent decay in QCD, except the model
as it stands does not include hadrons of higher mass than the nucleon. Finally, the hadronic tensor also receives a
contribution from the interference of these two, see Figure 4(b).
The hadronic tensor can be written as a sum of these three contributions:
W µν =
X

W (j),µν =
X

Ωk
d4k W(j),µν(k)

where Ωk indicates the 4-D integration region in k determined by four-momentum conservation and the external
kinematics. The individual, fully unintegrated contribution of each diagram in Figure 4, W(j),µν(k), can be calculated

(53)
Note that, following Ref. [48], in the second and third equations we took the liberty of shifting the integration variable
in order for the δ-functions to match those appearing in the DIS diagram.
We remark from Eq. (52) that the interference term contribution is nominally suppressed by a 1/(W 2 −M 2) factor
compared to the DIS term (51), due to the presence of one proton propagator. Similarly, the resonance term (53)
contains two proton propagators, and is nominally suppressed by one more power of W 2−M 2. As we will demonstrate
explicitly in Section III D, this scaling holds to a very good degree for transverse structure functions – hence the DIS
term dominates the process at asymptotically large Q2 or small Bjorken scaling variable xB = Q2/(2p · q), where
W 2 ∼Q2/xB. However, this is not the case for the longitudinal structure function where, due to the oﬀ-shellness of
the quark and proton propagators, all pieces are of similar magnitude and scale with 1/Q2.
Finally, it is important to stress that the individual contributions of the 3 diagrams considered in Figure 4 to
the hadronic tensor are not gauge invariant by themselves, but their sum (50) satisﬁes the electromagnetic Ward
identities [48]. Since, however, these diagrams contain heuristically distinguishable processes, in the next subsection
we propose a method to isolate their gauge invariant parts, and to obtain a unique and physically meaningful (although
only theoretical) decomposition of the hadronic tensor into a DIS, resonance, and interference contributions. This
decomposition will also allow us to test in Sections IV and V the validity of the collinear factorization procedure, that
only purports to approximate the DIS component of the e + p scattering cross section. In this respect, we diﬀer from
Ref. [48], where factorized calculations were compared to the full DIS+INT+RES model calculation.
B.
Gauge invariant decomposition into DIS, resonance, and interference processes
The strategy we follow to uniquely decompose a rank-2 tensor into a gauge invariant and a gauge breaking part is to
deﬁne a complete set of orthogonal rank-2 projectors, {P µν
λ }, maximizing the number that satisfy the electromagnetic
Ward identity, q ·Pλ ≡qµP µν
λ
= 0. Here we limit our treatment to the parity invariant tensors, such as those involved
in unpolarized DIS, but will complete the discussion in Appendix A.
Following [23, 32], we deﬁne longitudinal, transverse and scalar polarization vectors with respect to a longitudi-
nal momentum p (in our case the proton’s momentum) and a reference vector q (in our case the virtual photon’s
momentum) deﬁning the longitudinal direction and the transverse plane:
εµ
0(p, q) =
ˆpµ
p
ˆp2
εµ
±(p, q) =
1
√
2(0, ∓1, −i, 0)
εµ
q (p, q) =
qµ
p
−q2 ,
(54)
where ˆpµ ≡pµ −p·q
q2 qµ. We note that the transverse ε± polarization vectors indeed lie in the plane transverse to
both p and q (since ˆp · ε± = q · ε± = 0) and that the “longitudinal” ε0 polarization vector is transverse to the photon
momentum (q · ε0 = 0).
The polarization vectors form an orthogonal basis in Minkowski space,
ελ · ελ′ = 0
for λ ̸= λ′
ελ · ελ = 1
for λ = 0, +, −
(55)
εq · εq = −1 ,

18
and can be used to deﬁne parity invariant “helicity projectors” for rank 2 tensors. In particular, we deﬁne longitudinal,
transverse, scalar, and mixed projectors P µν
λ
, with λ = L, T, S, {LS}, as
P µν
L (p, q) = εµ
0(p, q)εν∗
0 (p, q)
P µν
T (p, q) = εµ
+(p, q)εν∗
+ (p, q) + εµ
−(p, q)εν∗
−(p, q)
P µν
S (p, q) = εµ
q (p, q)εν∗
q (p, q)
P µν
{LS}(p, q) = εµ
0(p, q)εν∗
q (p, q) + εµ
q (p, q)εν∗
0 (p, q) .
(56)
Taking advantage of
εµ
+(p, q)εν∗
+ (p, q) + εµ
−(p, q)εν∗
−(p, q) = −gµν + εµ
0(p, q)εν∗
0 (p, q) −εµ
q (p, q)εν∗
q (p, q)
(57)
and of the polarization vectors deﬁnition (54), the helicity projectors can be written in a more compact and suggestive
way as
P µν
L (p, q) = ˆpµˆpν
ˆp2
P µν
T (p, q) = −ˆgµν + ˆpµˆpν
ˆp2
P µν
S (p, q) = −qµqν
q2
P µν
{LS}(p, q) = ˆpµqν + qµˆpν

−q2ˆp2
,
(58)
where ˆgµν = gµν −qµqν
q2
is also transverse to the photon’s momentum. In either representation, it is straightforward
to verify that these projectors are orthogonal. Indeed,
Pλ · Pλ′ = 0
for λ ̸= λ′
Pλ · Pλ = 1
for λ = L, S
(59)
PT · PT = 2
P{LS} · P{LS} = −2 ,
where we have extended the use of the dot-product symbol to rank-2 tensors: Pλ · Pλ′ ≡P µν
λ Pλ′,µν. From Eq. (58),
it is clear that the 4 deﬁned projectors are also a complete orthogonal basis for symmetric tensors T µν = T µν(p, q)
that depend on the proton and photon momenta p and q, such as the hadronic tensor for inelastic e + p scattering.
Given a generic symmetric tensor, T µν = T µν(p, q), we can now deﬁne its helicity structure functions Fλ as the
projections of the tensor along the helicity basis deﬁned in Eq. (56) or (58):
Fλ(xB, Q2) ≡cλPλ(p, q) · T(p, q) .
(60)
with cλ = 1/(Pλ · Pλ). Thanks to the orthogonality and completeness of the helicity projectors, the tensor T can
then be decomposed as T µν(p, q) = P
λ Fλ(xB, Q2)P µν
λ (p, q). One can also go a step further, and separate this into a
gauge invariant and gauge breaking components. Indeed, the longitudinal and transverse projectors satisfy the Ward
identity,
q · PL,T ≡qµP µν
L,T = 0 ,
(61)
and it is immediate to verify that no linear combination of the scalar and mixed projectors can satisfy that condition,
either. Hence the longitudinal and transverse projectors form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of gauge
invariant hadronic tensors. Similarly, the scalar and mixed projectors form a complete orthogonal basis for maximally
gauge breaking tensors. As a result,
T µν(p, q) = T µν
inv.(p, q) + T µν
g.b.(p, q) ,
(62)
where
T µν
inv.(p, q) = P µν
T FT (xB, Q2) + P µν
L FL(xB, Q2)
(63)
T µν
g.b.(p, q) = P µν
S FS(xB, Q2) + P µν
{LS}F{LS} ,
(64)

19
are, respectively, the gauge invariant (inv.) and gauge breaking (g.b.) components of the tensor T µν. Accordingly, we
also call FT and FL “gauge invariant structure functions”, and FS and F{LS} “gauge breaking structure functions”.
Coming back to our model electron-proton scattering, we can apply this decomposition to each of the 3 processes
represented in Figure 5, and deﬁne their gauge invariant and gauge breaking parts:
2MW (j),µν
inv.
(p, q) = P µν
T F (j)
T (xB, Q2) + P µν
L F (j)

(65)

g.b
(p, q) = P µν
S F (j)
S (xB, Q2) + P µν
{LS}F (j)
{LS} ,
(66)
for j = DIS, INT, RES. The gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor (50) ensures that the sum of the gauge breaking
parts of each diagram in Figure 5 vanishes,
W µν
g.b =
X
(j)
W (j),µν
g.b
= 0
(j) = DIS, INT, RES
(67)
as one can also explicitly verify utilizing the algebraic manipulations discussed in [48], even though the individual
terms in the sum are diﬀerent from zero.
In summary, the gauge-invariant FT,L structure functions of each individual diagram in Figure 4 are physically
meaningful, and allow one to theoretically decompose each e + p scattering structure functions into DIS, resonance
and interference contributions. A more detailed discussion of this decomposition in the context of the scalar diquark
model will be oﬀered in Sections III D and III E.
C.
Kinematics
Like in e + p scattering in QCD, the Bjorken invariant in the model is bounded, as we discuss in more detail in
Appendix B:
0 < xB ≤
1
1 + (mφ+mq)2−M 2
Q2
≡xB,max .
(68)
The lower bound is due to the fact that in an electron-proton scattering the photon momentum is spacelike. The
upper bound, xB,max, is determined by the on-shell condition for particles belonging to a minimal mass 2-particle
ﬁnal state, and is analogous to the “pion threshold” xπ = 1/
h

in inelastic e + p collisions in QCD.
Likewise, the maximum transverse momentum squared for the scattered quark, k2
T,max, is determined by the available
invariant mass W 2 and the masses of the particles in the minimal mass ﬁnal state, see Appendix B for details:

(69)
It is interesting to note that the kinematic threshold in xB can only be reached at zero quark transverse momentum.
Indeed, solving k2
T,max = 0 for xB one recovers the upper limit in (68).
We can now explicitly write each of the contributions to the hadronic tensor (50) as an integral over the parton’s
transverse and longitudinal momentum and virtuality:
W (j),µν(xB, Q2) =
Z k2
T,max
0
dk2

(70)
where
W(j),µν(x, k2, k 2
T ) = π
2x W(j),µν(k)
(71)
is the fully unintegrated hadronic tensor in the x, k2 and k 2
T variables, and the Wj(k) tensors on the right are deﬁned
in Eqs. (51)-(53). It is important to note that the integral in dk2
T appearing in Eq. (70) is limited from above by the
maximum transverse momentum squared for the scattered quark deﬁned in Eq. (69).
At LO, due to the δ−functions in the unintegrated hadronic tensors that originate, as mentioned, from the upper
and lower cuts in the diagrams of Figure 4, the integrals over dx and dk2 can be explicitly calculated, and we can
explicitly calculate the k 2
T -unintegrated (but x- and k−-integrated) hadronic tensor W(k 2

arises from the manipulation of the delta functions, and the tilde sign over the hadronic tensor symbol indicates the
removal of these from Eqs. (51)-(53). The whole expression (72) is then evaluated at x = xex(k 2
T ) and k = k2
ex(k 2
T ),
which are the solutions of the said delta functions and are explicitly derived in Appendix B 3, see Eqs. (B11)-(B12).
In Eq. (73) we have highlighted the role of the mass scales: beside the external proton mass M 2 and photon
virtuality Q2, the Jacobian also depends on the “light-cone virtuality”
v2 = k2 + k 2
T
(74)
of the struck quark, already deﬁned in Eq. (7).
It is now instructive to look in more detail at the internal kinematics of the process.
In fact, in an inclusive
scattering, the 4-momentum of the scattered quark is not measured, and therefore neither x, nor k2, nor k 2
T can be
experimentally determined. Nonetheless, in the spectator model we do have explicit control over these variables – a
major theme of this article – in particular through the analysis of the momentum ﬂow through the cuts in Figure 4.
For example, the light-cone fraction x is determined by the the cut of the quark line in the top part of the diagrams,
that gives rise to the δ((k + q)2 −m2
q) function in Eqs. (51)-(53). This delta function imposes

(76)
In the second line, the constraint is expanded in inverse powers of Q2 and acquires a suggestive form, that in fact
holds at any order in the expansion. In detail, in Eq. (76), x depends only on two mass scales: the transverse mass
m2
qT ≡m2
q + k 2

(77)
which can be obtained by replacing p2

φ in Eq. (38) and depends on the target’s fragmentation dynamics,
encapsulated in mφ. Notably, the light-cone virtuality vanishes when x →0, diverges to negative inﬁnity as x →1,
and is negative over the whole range in x for physical choices of the mφ parameter as can be expected of a bound
particle6. This also means that the quark is oﬀits k2 = m2
q mass shell over the whole range of xB. This analysis will
be substantiated in Section IV, with an explicit calculation of the average values of the internal kinematic variables
as a function of Bjorken’s xB.
It is ﬁnally important to note that the light-cone virtuality enters Eq. (76) only starting at order O(1/Q4). Therefore,
x and v2 are coupled essentially only through the quark transverse momentum squared k 2
T , which is the only variable
left free in the loop integrations (51)-(53). Since, as discussed, v2 remains small except close to the kinematic threshold,
where it can become substantially large and negative, truncating Eq. (76) to ﬁrst order in the 1/Q2 expansion appears
to be a meaningful approximation over much of the inclusive scattering’s (xB, Q2) phase space. These considerations
form the basis for the kinematic approximations needed to perform collinear factorization in DIS at sub-asymptotic
energy, as discussed in Section II and numerically tested in Section IV.
D.
Transverse structure function
Having discussed the hadronic and partonic kinematics, and isolated the gauge invariant part of the DIS, resonance,
and interference diagrams in Figure 4 with the aid of Eqs. (65) and the projections (60), we can study their individual
6 The only way the light-cone virtuality can become positive and large is if mφ ≪M, such that v2 ≈xM2 −k 2
T /(1 −x). Evaluating this
at k 2
T ∼Λ2 ∼0.4M2, the maximum light-cone virtuality remains nonetheless small, only reaching v2
max ∼0.1M2 at x ∼0.4 before
dropping below 0 as x →1. This is, however, a quite unphysical choice of diquark mass because φ represents the proton’s remnant, and
thus one would expect mφ ∼M.

21
role in the e + p scattering process. We focus ﬁrst on the transverse structure function FT , which, in our model, gives
the dominant contribution to the inelastic cross section, and discuss FL in the next subsection.
As discussed in Section III B, the individual DIS, interference and resonance structure functions can be obtained
by projecting the respective hadronic tensors:
F (j)
T
= M P µν
T W (j)
µν
(j) = DIS, INT, RES .
(78)
In the case of the DIS contribution, F DIS
T
describes the scattering of a transversely polarized photon with a quark
emitted by the proton (see Figure 4(a)). Analogously, the resonance F RES
T
structure function describes a transverse
photon that scatters on the proton as a whole (see Figure 4(c)). Therefore we expect these structure functions to be
non negative:
F DIS

M q

(79)
F RES
T
∝
M p
T
2 ≥0
(80)
where M q,p
T
are the scattering amplitude of the transverse photon-quark and transverse photon-proton processes.
This is conﬁrmed in Figure 5, where we numerically evaluate all components of FT in the spectator model at LO,
and show that F DIS
T
and F RES
T
are indeed positive at all values of xB and Q2. In contrast, the interference structure
function F INT
T
can have any sign, and in our model it turns out to be negative deﬁnite – and not too small, either.
In the left panel of Figure 5, we use a value of Q2 = 4 GeV2 and notice that at small xB the DIS contribution is
the dominant one. Nonetheless, the interference piece is large and non negligible even at intermediate and large xB,
and is largely responsible for the visible diﬀerence between the DIS curve (blue) and the total contribution (black).
The resonance piece has an extended but small tail at lower xB, and increases in magnitude as xB →1, where in
principle it would diverge. However, this divergence is cut oﬀby the phase space, that limits xB < xmax
B
< 1 when
mq + mφ > M, as in our model. The interplay of the resonance at xB = 1 and phase space limitations produces an
asymmetric bump at xB ≲xmax
B
. This bump becomes visually more prominent and narrow in the total contribution,
that seems separated into an inelastic contribution at xB ≲0.75 and a resonance peak at xB ≳0.75. However, the
trough at xB ≈0.75 is actually a combined eﬀect of the resonance and interference pieces, whose inﬂuence extends
beyond the edge of phase space, well into what one may consider to be the deep inelastic region. In Appendix C,
we discuss for completeness the calculation for the mq + mφ < M case, where the resonant behavior of the proton
excitation is in full display (see Figure 14).

(right plot) for the model parameters speciﬁed in Section III [see Eqs. (48)-(49)]. The kinematic thresholds are xB,max = 0.913
and 0.976, respectively.
In e + p scattering, it is important to separate the DIS contribution from the rest, because it is this one that can
be factorized into a perturbatively calculable photon-parton hard scattering coeﬃcient and a non-perturbative parton
distribution function, thus giving one access to the partonic structure of the target:

where W µν
LT is given in Eq. (29).

What the model shows, however, is that the needed phenomenological separation of the DIS piece must be done
carefully, and cannot rely only on phenomenological cuts (for example on W 2) to eliminate the apparent resonance
“peak”. Instead, one needs to also exploit the Q2 dependence of the structure function, since, as already observed,
the interference contribution is parametrically suppressed by a factor
1
W 2−M 2 ∼1/Q2 compared to DIS, and the
resonance contribution is suppressed by
1
(W 2−M 2)2 ∼1/Q4.
(In the latter case the parametric scaling does not
fully hold numerically, although the resonance piece is still suppressed compared to the resonance contribution, see
Appendix D.)
To illustrate the Q2 suppression of the interference and resonance contributions, we show our calculations for
Q2 = 16 GeV2 in the right panel of Figure 5. In this case the interference term contribution is suppressed compared
to the plot in the left panel, but still still appreciable. The resonance contribution is negligible except at very high
xB values closer to the kinematic threshold, that moved to the right compared to the left panel. There it becomes
the dominant contribution, and, combined with the interference, again gives rise to a narrow, but now smaller,
“peak”. Overall, the DIS piece dominates although a not yet necessarily negligible interference contribution is visible
at intermediate xB. At yet higher Q2 values the DIS piece would become the dominant contribution over most of the
available xB range, except right before the kinematic threshold.
While an experimental measurement is only sensitive to the full structure function, the scaling just described
allows to phenomenologically control, for example, just the DIS component in a ﬁt that includes power-suppressed
H(x)/Q2 terms, with H(x) a suitable polynomial in x, and utilizes data in as large a (xB, Q2) range as possible. This
was ﬁrst tried in Ref. [72], and more recently implemented in global ﬁts of parton distributions by the CTEQ-JLab
collaboration [73–75], the JAM collaboration [76], and by Alekhin and collaborators [77, 78]. A similar ﬁt utilizing
data generated from the spectator model goes beyond the scope of this paper, but will be presented elsewhere [79].
Instead, in Sections IV and V we will compare the analytically isolated DIS component of the model’s structure
function to its factorized approximation to validate the latter.
E.
Longitudinal structure function
For completeness, in Figure 6 we present the model calculation of the longitudinal structure function FL, even
though we will not discuss this further in the rest of the paper, since in collinear factorization F CF
L
= 0 at LO. The
behavior of the longitudinal FL structure function, illustrated in Figure 6, changes drastically from what we have
discussed for its transverse FT counterpart in at least two respects. Firstly, all 3 components scale approximately as
1/Q2, instead of displaying the hierarchy discussed for the transverse case. Secondly, FL →0 also as xB →0; however,
each one of the three components remains diﬀerent from zero, and, in fact, F DIS
L
→F RES
L
. We will analytically study
the highlighted features of FL in Appendix D, and oﬀer here a heuristic explanation for these.
For the DIS component, the 1/Q2 scaling behavior can be understood by noticing that, if the scattered quark was
on its mass shell, the Callan-Gross relation would be satisﬁed and one would ﬁnd F DIS
L
= 0. However, the quark is
virtual, and we can expect the Callan-Gross relation to be broken by an amount proportional to the quark’s average
virtuality normalized by the scale of the process, which is provided by the invariant mass W 2: namely, F DIS
L
∝
⟨k2⟩/W 2 ∝Λ2/Q2. Note that we have used ⟨k2⟩= O(Λ2), because this is the scale that determines the behavior of
proton vertex’s form factor Y, and therefore determines the quark’s nonperturbative dynamics in the model. This
argument also justiﬁes the much smaller size of the DIS component of FL compared to that of FT . For the resonance
piece, the same argument can be applied to the scattered proton, whose virtuality is equal to W 2 by four-momentum
conservation.
The only scale left to neutralize this is Λ2, hence we can expect F RES
L
∝
1
W 4 × W 2
Λ2
∝1/(Λ2Q2),
where the fourth inverse power of the invariant mass is due to the proton propagator, as evident from Eq. (53). The
conﬁnement scale now appears at the denominator, enhancing the resonance piece relative to the DIS contribution
(in the transverse case it was much suppressed, instead). The interference piece is a mixture of these two, and we can
expect FL ∝
1
W 2 ×
q
Λ2
Q2
q
W 2
Λ2 ∝
1
Q2 . In all cases, the three components of the longitudinal structure function scale
as 1/Q2, as we will analytically corroborate in Appendix D.
The limiting behavior of the full FL, which vanishes as xB →0, is a general consequence of gauge invariance.
Indeed, one can easily see that the longitudinal projector satisﬁes
P µν
L (p, q) −−−−→

Noticing that PS is one of the two gauge-breaking operators discussed in Section III B, we obtain

The last equality is in fact valid for any gauge invariant tensor, see Eq. (67), and therefore also for inelastic scattering
at LO in our model, as plotted in Figure 6. Unitarity then imposes speciﬁc small-xB constraints for the resonance
and interference components of FL:

Indeed, since the two individual e+p scattering amplitudes involving the longitudinal photon-quark and the longitudi-
nal photon-proton interactions are imaginary, Mq,p
L
= iTq,p, the vanishing of FL in that limit imposes T 2
q +T 2
p −2TqTp =
(Tq −Tp)2 →0.
Let us stress that Eqs. (83)-(85), are consequence of electromagnetic gauge invariance rather than special features
of the model we have considered. What is not constrained by general principles is the limiting behavior of the DIS
contribution, that at small xB could as well tend to zero or diverge (in which case, we note that the interference term
should also diverge but with opposite sign). The fact that it is, instead ﬁnite, is a feature of the chosen spectator
model, as we will analytically demonstrate in Appendix D, where we will also prove the common 1/Q2 scaling behavior.
In closing this section, we recall that the spectator model we are considering is only designed to account for the
quark dynamics inside the proton, and therefore can only mimic electron-proton scattering in the “valence quark
region” at large xB ≳0.2. In QCD, the DIS longitudinal structure function at small xB is instead dominated by
photon-gluon fusion interactions, that the model as it stands cannot describe7. Nonetheless, the conclusion that
FL →0 as xB →0 is a consequence of electromagnetic gauge invariance, and as such is model independent. Therefore
we can also expect this to happen in nature. In fact, data on inelastic e+p scattering gathered at HERA [81–83] show
that FL ﬁrst grows as xB decreases towards xB ∼10−4, then falls oﬀas xB becomes smaller than that value, contrary
to expectations from perturbation theory. Many explanations have been advanced for this observation, including
higher twist eﬀects [59, 78, 84–86] and deviations from perturbative QCD evolution [87–90]. Here, we are suggesting
that a further source of deviation from perturbative calculations of FL is due to the limiting behavior of this structure
function, that is forced by gauge symmetry to vanish at small xB.
IV.
TESTING THE KINEMATIC APPROXIMATIONS
In deriving the factorized hadronic tensor (29) in Section II, we have distinguished dynamical and kinematical
approximations, namely, the inclusion of the parton transverse momentum loop integral contribution into the twist
expansion, and the choice of approximate light cone virtualities ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 entering the calculation of the collinear
hard scattering tensor Hµν.
The twist expansion is controlled by powers of µ2/Q2 and can be calculated up to any desired order (although each
order eventually needs the introduction of one or more new non-perturbative functions). The light cone virtualities,
7 A generalization of the model to include gluon dynamics has been discussed in Ref. [80].

24
instead, are not observable nor can they be experimentally controlled. Thus, as discussed in Section II E, we can
only resort to a physically or theoretically motivated Ansatz to choose suitable ¯v 2 and ¯v ′ 2 values. Contrary to the
twist expansion, this approximation cannot be systematically improved. In the spectator model, however, one also
has full control of the unobserved (or “internal”) variables, and our choices can be in fact veriﬁed by comparing the
approximated internal variables with their average value.
Let us then deﬁne the average of a generic function O = O(x, k2, k 2
T ) of the internal variables as:
⟨O⟩(xB, Q2) =
R k2
T,max
0
dk 2
T dk2dx O(x, k2, k 2
T )FDIS
T
(x, k2, k 2

R k2
T,max
0
dk 2
T dk2dx FDIS
T
(x, k2, k 2
T )xB,Q2
,
(86)
where k2
T,max was deﬁned in Eq. (69), and the fully unintegrated structure function FDIS
T
is deﬁned as the transverse
projection of the fully unintegrated DIS hadronic tensor (51):
FDIS
T
(x, k2, k 2
T )xB,Q2 = M P µν
T WDIS
µν (x, k2, k 2
T )xB,Q2 .
(87)
The dependence of ⟨O⟩on xB and Q2 is due to the hard scattering delta function inside FT , and is symbolically
denoted in the subscript following the functional dependence on the internal variables. The denominator at the right
hand side of Eq. (86) is easily recognized as the inclusive DIS transverse function F DIS
T
.
Furthermore, in the model one can calculate not only the hard-scattering term, but also the PDFs themselves.
Hence one can perform a detailed comparison of the factorized vs. full cross section test the range of validity of the
collinear factorization approximation. This will be discussed in Section V. In the remaining of this Section we will
focus on the validity of the kinematic approximations, to which we now turn our attention.
A.
Kinematic approximations in the model
In Section II E, we discussed a theoretical Ansatz to justify the choice of the approximated ¯v2 ≈⟨v2⟩and v ′ 2 ≈
⟨v′2⟩parton light-cone virtualities, and of the approximate ¯x scaling variable that enter the collinear factorization
formula (29)-(32). That discussion, that was tailored to QCD, can be repeated for the spectator model with simple
modiﬁcations.
To start with, we consider the approximate light-cone virtuality of the scattered quark, ¯v ′ 2 ≈⟨k′2 + k′ 2
T ⟩. In the
model, isolated quarks exist as asymptotic states. Hence the virtuality k′2 must be at least as large as m2
q, and since
we do not measure the quark’s transverse momentum in an inclusive process we can only choose
¯v ′ 2 = m2
q .
(88)
Next, we consider the scattering quark’s virtuality ¯v 2, and notice that the target’s remnant is represented in the
model by the spectator φ. Thus, we can substitute pX ⇝pφ and m2
X ⇝m2
φ in Eq. (38), repeat the ensuing derivation,
and eventually ﬁnd
¯v 2 = 0
(89)
as our standard choice. Analogously to the QCD case, we expect to be a good approximation for small enough xB
and not too large quark masses.
Finally, utilizing in Eq. (32) the light-cone virtuality choices (88) and (89), one obtains
¯x ≈ξ

1 + m2
q
Q2

≡ξq .
(90)
With a non-zero ¯v ′ 2 like in Eq. (88) we are more closely respecting the internal kinematics of the handbag diagram
than with ¯v ′ 2 = 0. Therefore, we can expect ¯x = ξq to provide a better approximation to the non-factorized diagram’s
than in standard collinear factorization. In fact, our ξq is analogous to the χ scaling variable used for example in
Ref. [23] to study charm production in charged current W + s →c events, which was indeed found to capture much
of the heavy quark production kinematics even when setting the quark masses equal to zero in the calculation of the
hard scattering coeﬃcient [55].
As in QCD, the model’s virtuality diverges to minus inﬁnity at large values of xB, see Eq. (77), and a diﬀerent
approximation may be needed. Analogously to the detailed discussion in Section II E, a suitable approximation to
the model’s v2 that is valid in both the small and large-xB regimes is

Substituting Eq. (91) in Eq. (32), solving the resulting equation for ¯x perturbatively in powers of µ2/Q2, and ﬁnally
setting ¯v ′ 2 = m2

. Note that at small xB the fourth order term quickly vanishes, and one recovers Eq. (90).
Closer to the kinematic threshold, this new scaling variables accounts for the non-vanishing of the scattered quark’s
light-cone virtuality. Substituting this back in Eq. (91) we can also write the corresponding virtuality purely in terms
of external variables:
¯v 2
∗≡¯v 2(ξ∗
q) .
(93)
The scaling variable we just obtained are suitable for collinear factorization of inclusive scattering processes. By
necessity, however, they neglect the kinematic eﬀect of the internal transverse momentum, because no particles other
than the scattered lepton is measured in the ﬁnal state, so that no measured scale is available to control the size of
⟨k 2
T ⟩. Nonetheless, Eq. (76), shows that k 2
T contributes to the scaling variables at the same order as m2
q, and it would
be desirable to estimate the size of its contribution.
Contrary to the QCD case, an estimate of the average transverse momentum squared is actually possible in the
model, where ⟨k 2
T ⟩can be explicitly calculated using Eq. (86). The result is presented in Figure 7 as a function of xB
at several values of Q2. The upper left panel utilizes the default model parameter choices discussed in Section III, and
the other two panels increase, respectively, the values of the target mass and the quark mass8. A comprehensive study
of the systematic dependence on the model parameters is presented in Appendix E. As one can expect, ⟨k 2
T ⟩= O(Λ2)
is of non perturbative origin and determined by the “conﬁnement” scale Λ, with a mild dependence on the model
parameters (see also Figure 15). The average transverse momentum squared is independent of the scattering kinematics
at small xB, then decreases at large xB, where four momentum conservation limits the amount of invariant energy in
the ﬁnal state and forces this to vanish: ⟨k 2
T ⟩→0 as xB →xmax
B
(see Appendix B for more detail). Leveraging the
detailed calculations in Appendix B we can then deﬁne theoretical, transverse-momentum-improved scaling variables
simply by substituting m2

With these we will theoretically estimate the importance of including in the calculation the transverse momentum

B.
Numerical validation
In order to numerically study the validity of the kinematic approximations discussed in Section IV A, we will consider
the sequence of ¯x scaling variables summarized in Table I. Starting with Eq. (90), we neglect at ﬁrst the scattered
quark virtuality as well as all external mass scales (i.e., M = 0, mq = 0), then consecutively switch on the target mass
and the quark mass. Subsequently, we consider the non-zero parton virtuality eﬀects captured in Eq. (92). Finally
we analyze the kinematic impact of the parton transverse momentum by utilizing Eq. (94).
We start from the average light-cone virtuality ⟨v2⟩= ⟨k2 + k 2
T ⟩, shown as a black line in Figure 8 and compared
to the 3 choices of approximated ¯v 2 deﬁned in Eqs. (89), (93) and (95). At small xB, all vanish and the parton can
be eﬀectively considered collinear to the nucleon in the plus light-cone direction. As xB increases, however, the light
cone virtuality becomes more and more negative until the kinematic threshold xB,max is reached. The only exception
occurs at larger target mass values, for which a modest rise with xB is followed again by a fast dive as xB approaches
its threshold. This behavior was already expected from the analysis of Eq. (77) oﬀered in Section III C. The deviation
of ⟨v2⟩from ¯v 2 = 0 is qualitatively captured by ¯v 2
∗, and the remaining small gap is closed if the transverse momentum
is taken into account by including the calculated, but unobserved, ⟨k 2
T ⟩into ¯v 2
∗T .
8 This layout will be used also when studying other internal variables in this Section, and for the study of factorized vs. full structure
function in Section V.

TABLE I. Sequence of kinematic approximations considered for the validation of the ¯x scaling variables choices discussed in
Section IV A. A check mark indicates the inclusion of the particle masses M or mq in (90), and the approximation used for the
internal v2 and k 2
T variables is indicated in the last two columns. Below the thin horizontal line, we included an approximation
that can be considered for benchmarking purposes in the spectator model, where the dynamics of internal degrees of freedom is
explicitly known, but not in QCD. (The ¯v 2
∗and ¯v 2
∗T light-cone virtualities are deﬁned in Eqs. (93) and (95), respectively, and
the corresponding scaling variables in Eqs. (92) and (94). The average transverse momentum ⟨k 2
T ⟩is calculated in the model
according to Eq. (86).)
It is worthwhile remarking that the plots in Figs. 7-8, combined, also show that the incoming quark virtuality
⟨k2⟩= ⟨v2⟩−⟨k 2
T ⟩is negative and of order O(Λ2) at all xB values: the quark is indeed a bound state of the proton.
Clearly, the k2 ≈0 approximation utilized in many parton model calculations and derivations of factorization formulas
is not accurate, and should rather be replaced, by v2 ≈0. Remarkably, as we will see, this approximation is quite
suﬃcient in describing the average value of the quark light-cone momentum fraction x and there will be no need to
use a non-zero virtuality such as ¯v 2
∗in the calculation of inclusive observables.
The average light-cone fraction ⟨x⟩is another important internal variable that can be calculated in the model but
can only be indirectly controlled experimentally by measuring the Bjorken invariant xB. The comparison to the 5
approximations listed in Table I is performed for clarity by plotting the corresponding ¯x/⟨x⟩ratios as a function of
xB in Figure 9, where we adopted the same choice of kinematics and model parameters as in the average light-cone
virtuality just discussed. One can immediately see that the standard massless collinear approximation ¯x = xB (blue
line) very poorly approximates the parton’s average fractional momentum, and results in a ¯x/⟨x⟩ratio that is very
sensitive to the model parameters. While this is not a problem at small xB, where a small shift in the x value at
which the PDFs are calculated does not signiﬁcantly alter the cross section, this can lead to signiﬁcant under- or
over-estimation of the structure functions at larger xB. On the contrary, keeping into account the target’s mass
inside the ¯x = ξ scaling variable stabilizes the large xB approximation, even though the new scaling variable can still
signiﬁcantly underestimate ⟨x⟩, especially if the quark is heavy, see the green line. This is remedied by including the
quark mass inside ¯x = ξq (red line), which produces a good approximation for the model parameter values considered
in Figure 9. In fact, the approximation degrades for higher values of the “conﬁnement” scale Λ or the spectator mass
mφ, see Appendix E. The latter case is particularly meaningful because, in reality, the proton’s remnant after the hard
scattering is a multi-particle state with a distribution in invariant mass not fully captured by a ﬁxed mφ ∼⟨mX⟩.
Finally, one can consider the eﬀects of a non-vanishing virtuality ¯v 2
∗, which however are suppressed by 1/Q4 and do
not improve much the approximation, see the purple line compared to the red one.
In summary, there seems indeed to be a limit to what any experimentally controllable inclusive DIS kinematic
approximation to ⟨x⟩can achieve. However, as it was the case for ⟨v2⟩, if one was able to control the partonic k 2
T
accessed in the hard scattering reaction, the approximation would become nearly perfect, as the orange dashed lines
representing ξ∗
qT /⟨x⟩shows. In Section VI we will brieﬂy discuss how this could in fact be achieved, either by utilizing
the TMD factorization formalism, or including HT terms in the collinear calculation.
V.
TESTING THE LIMITS OF FACTORIZATION
The model’s hadronic tensor can be factorized according to Eqs. (29)-(33). It is then possible to compute the
factorized transverse structure function F CF
T
by contracting the tensor with the transverse projector PT of Eq. (58).
One ﬁnds:
F CF
T
(xB, Q2) = q(¯x) ,
(96)
which at LO coincides with the quark PDF evaluated at a suitable ¯x variable, that replaces xB as scaling variable away
from the Bjorken limit. In the numerical analysis to follow, the ¯x scaling variable chosen as summarized in Table I.
Working analogously with the longitudinal projector PL of Eq. (58), the longitudinal structure function vanishes at
LO, F CF
L
= 0 and will not be further considered.

In the model, we can therefore test the validity of the proposed sub-asymptotic collinear factorization by comparing
the factorized and full calculations of the DIS transverse structure functions. By also comparing kT -unintegrated
structure functions, we will furthermore be able to numerically explore the conditions for the breakdown of this
approximation.

A.
Validity of the factorization approximations
We ﬁrst study to what degree collinear factorization provides a good approximation of the DIS process in the model
by comparing the full F DIS
T
calculated as in Eq. (78) with the factorized F CF
T
calculated with the model PDF (99)
according to Eq. (96). (The longitudinal structure function identically vanishes at LO, and an analogous test would
require one to extend the model calculation to NLO, which goes beyond the scope of this article.)
We do this ﬁrst in Figure 10, where F DIS
T
is plotted as a black line, and various factorized F CF
T
structure functions
computed at Q2 = 4 GeV2 with the scaling variables collected in Table I are represented by colored lines. We adopt
the same choice of model parameters as in the study of the internal kinematics performed in Section IV B, and present
a more detailed study of model parameter variations in Appendix E.
One can immediately notice the same pattern observed in Section IV B. Firstly, the asymptotic kinematic choice
¯x = xB (blue line) is very unstable with respect to the model parameters, as already observed in Ref. [48] for kT -
dependent structure functions. Secondly, taking into account mass corrections by using the ¯x = ξq or ¯x = ξ∗
q scaling
variables provides a much more stable and numerically closer approximation of F DIS
T
. Finally, the k 2
T corrections
theoretically estimated with ¯x = ξ∗
qT (but not controllable experimentally) explain most of the remaining diﬀerences.
One can also see that none of the factorized cross sections respect the kinematic xB ≤xB,max bound (unless one
worked strictly in the Bjorken Q2 →∞limit), which is a ﬁrst illustration of the fact that the adopted factorization
approximation breaks 4-momentum conservation, as already remarked in Section II.
The hierarchy of approximations just discussed can be better appreciated in Figure 11, where we show the ratio of
the F CF
T
collinear structure functions to their exact F DIS
T
counterpart. The fact that F CF
T
|¯x=xB does not approximate
F DIS
T
in any accurate way, can be traced to the failure of xB to approximate the average partonic momentum fraction
⟨x⟩.
For example looking at the blue line in Figure 11(a), where the default model parameters are utilized, we
see that the CF structure function overestimates the exact DIS calculation at small xB, then suddenly drops and
underestimates it even down to the ∼50% level before surging again closer to the kinematic threshold. This behavior
can be understood from Figure 9(a), where the choice ¯x = xB ﬁrst underestimates the average ⟨x⟩at xB ≲0.6
then overestimates it at xB ≳0.6, right around the value where F CF
T
|¯x=xB becomes smaller than F DIS
T
. This clearly
highlights the need of a more accurate kinematic approximation, which is indeed reached by fully taking into account
the target and quark masses in ¯x = ξq. The order O(1/Q4) corrections included in ¯x = ξ∗
q do not qualitatively improve
the agreement of F CF
T
with F DIS
T
.
In summary, it is clear that the use of the ¯x = ξq scaling variable eﬀectively provides the closest F CF
T
approximation
to the real one, and extends the kinematic range of validity of CF to the largest xB value that can be achieved
considering only external variables. The validity of CF is naturally extended at larger Q2, where mass eﬀects are
suppressed by an inverse of power of the photon virtuality and become sizable only in an increasingly narrow region
close to the kinematic threshold, see Figure 12.
As observed many times, however, the CF cross section at leading twist misses transverse momentum eﬀects, which
are of the same order of magnitude, parametrically, as the mass eﬀects successfully incorporated in ξq. The “missing”
k 2
T corrections can nonetheless be theoretically estimated by choosing ¯x = ξ∗
q, and are shown as a dashed orange
line in Figures 11 and 12. The model DIS calculation is largely reproduced in this way, showing that maximizing
the range of validity of a factorized calculation requires one to control transverse-motion-induced power corrections.
Even though these are beyond the scope of our leading twist calculation, one can handle their contribution to the
cross section either by extending collinear factorization to higher-twist [29, 53] or by utilizing a TMD formalism,
where these are taken into account at parton distribution level [42, 52]. We will discuss this point more extensively
in Section VI.
B.
Breaking of Collinear Factorization
Even after considering transverse momentum contributions, one can notice in Figures 11 and 12 that the ratio
F CF
T
/F DIS
T
strongly deviates from 1 at a Bjorken momentum fraction xB larger than a scale-dependent, “factorization
breaking” threshold xB,break = xB,break(Q2). Deﬁning breaking of factorization as a ∼10% deviation of the CF
structure function from the exactly calculated one, we obtain the values of xB,break collected in Table II, where
we also indicate the corresponding value of W 2 in parentheses, denoted by W 2
break. A more complete study of the
parameter systematics can be found in Appendix E.
Phenomenologically, one can notice that the dependence of xB,break on Q2 and on the model parameters, both

(101)
Indeed, the larger the target mass M the higher the xB value where factorization breaks down, and the larger the
quark mass mq (or indeed the remnant’s mφ) the smaller the breaking threshold. We can thus see that breaking of
factorization is mostly a kinematic eﬀect, and occurs when the process is too close to the edge of phase space. As a
rule of thumb, we can see that this happens when
W 2 ≲4 GeV2 ,
(102)
with the quoted numerical value being a slight overestimate of the worst case combination of parameters shown here
or in Appendix E. Even if this value was onained by a numerical analysis of calculations performed in the adopted
spectator model, the parameters of latter have been chosen to phenomenologically reproduce the PDFs extracted in
QCD by means of global ﬁts and thus we can take the model to be a fair proxy for the latter. This makes us hopeful
that the region of applicability of collinear factorization may be controlled at least in ﬁrst approximation by a simple
kinematic cuts even in QCD (and in that case, it looks like one would simply need to neglect the hadron resonance
region, which is anyway removed from global QCD ﬁts).
Theoretically, the breaking of factorization can be traced back to the violation of momentum conservation in
the kinematic approximations (19)–(20), and in particular to the lack of transverse momentum conservation in the
factorized diagram [48]. To see this explicitly, let us deﬁne the kT -unintegrated DIS structure function
FDIS

(103)
where the fully unintegrated DIS structure function appearing in the integrand was deﬁned in Eqs. (87) as the
P µν

µν (k) projection of the fully unintegrated DIS hadronic tensor. Similarly, we can deﬁne the kT -unintegrated
CF structure function as
FCF

The crucial diﬀerence is the limit of integration: in the DIS case, k 2
T is limited by four momentum conservation
at any ﬁxed value of the invariant mass W 2, and the integrand does not have support beyond k2
T,max; in the CF
calculation, k 2
T can run up to inﬁnity after being eﬀectively decoupled from the light-cone plus and minus directions
by the approximations (19)–(20).
The diﬀerence between the handling of kT in the DIS and the CF calculations is evident from Figure 13, where the
kT -dependent FT structure functions are plotted as a function of k 2
T for xB = 0.6, Q2 = 4 GeV2, and nominal model
parameter values.
At small k 2
T , we have a generally good enough approximation, except when using the ¯x = xB scaling variable (blue
line) that consistently underestimates the transverse structure function. On the contrary, taking into account both
the target and the quark mass in the ¯x = ξq scaling variable provides one with the best approximation achievable
considering only external variables. Nonetheless, this calculation slightly overestimates the full one and displays a
less steep slope. This cannot be remedied without handling the transverse motion of the quark in detail, which one
cannot do at LT in collinear factorization; however, including the average ⟨k 2
T ⟩in the theoretical ¯x = ξ∗
qT scaling
variable, one can obtain a good description on average of the full FDIS
T
, slightly underestimating it at small k 2
T values,
and slightly overestimating it at intermediate k 2
T values. This is the reason why the ¯x = ξ∗
qT choice gives the best
approximation for the kT -integrated FT previously discussed.
At even larger values of k 2
T the factorized calculation is radically diﬀerent: the black DIS curve displays an integrable
divergence at k2
T,max, while the CF colored curves have noticeable tails beyond that. At high Q2 values, this happens
at large enough k 2
T that he unintegrated FT , dropping approximately as an inverse power of k 2
T , does not contribute
much to the integrated FT . However, at smaller Q2 values the CF tail exceeding the kinematic limit provides a non
negligible contribution to FT . In order to quantify this contribution, we deﬁne the ratio

down for (xB, Q2) values such that 20% or more of the integrated F CF

T,max.
The breaking of factorization just described is unavoidable, as it is rooted in the very approximation that allows one
to deﬁne the quark PDF as an integral of the quark correlator Φ over the sub-leading parton momentum components
kT and k+, and to factorize these from the parton-level, hard scattering. Being rooted in kinematics, however, the
values xB and Q2 at which the breakdown occurs can be at least qualitatively, if not semi-quantitatively, controlled by
calculating the kinematic limits and estimating how far from these one should safely stay. As argued in the previous
subsection in the context of our spectator model, a simple cut in W 2 may indeed be suﬃcient for inclusive structure
functions. However, similar issues appear and are ampliﬁed in the case of semi-inclusive DIS measurements, and
in particular when the hadron’s transverse momentum is also measured [39–41]. More reﬁned analyses are urgently
called for, especially in the context of the Jeﬀerson Lab SIDIS program at the 12 GeV upgraded CEBAF facility [14],
where the kinematics is inherently sub-asymptotic due to the relatively low beam energy.
VI.
THEORY AND PHENOMENOLOGY BEYOND THE LEADING TWIST
Summarizing the numerical validation performed in the last 2 sections, there is a limit to the degree of accuracy
with which a CF calculation can reproduce the inclusive DIS structure functions. We have identiﬁed 2 main drivers
for this:
• There is an intrinsic limitation in the approximation of high-kT scattering contributions, due to the neglect of
transverse momentum conservation in the factorization of the non-perturbative parton correlator;
• the kinematic ¯x scaling variable in inclusive processes can only be determined using external variables, and
cannot incorporate the unobserved transverse momentum scale.
The ﬁrst limitation is unavoidable, and one should try to identify in what region of phase space this occurs, in
order to ensure that factorization is properly applied to describe experimental data and, conversely, to accurately
extract parton distribution from these. In this paper, we suggest that, at least for inclusive observables, a measure
of control over the validity of the factorized description of the scattering can be reached by kinematic considerations,
and in particular by estimating xB,max. The latter can be calculated exactly in the model, where all masses are known
and all particles are asymptotic states, but in QCD one would would need some phenomenological input to obtain
useful estimates. Identifying the region of applicability of factorization in semi-inclusive measurements is, instead,
signiﬁcantly more intricate [39–41]. In both cases, we believe this is an important endeavor and more detailed studies
are needed to avoid interpreting as partonic features of the data that are not. This is of capital importance, for
example, to fully exploit the vast mess of data expected from the Jeﬀerson Lab 12 GeV program [14].
Even within the region of validity of factorization, an imperfect description of the DIS cross section at large xB
arises due to the neglect of transverse momentum in the factorized calculation at leading twist, see Figures 11, 12
and 18. However, after incorporating all external mass scales in the ¯x = ξq scaling variable, the diﬀerence between
the LT and the full cross section is small, and quite independent of the Λ and mφ internal parameters that mimic
the nonperturbative QCD dynamics of the target.
As demonstrated by incorporating in the scaling variable the
(unmeasured, but calculable in the model) ⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2 corrections, the calculation seems systematically improvable.
The needed control of the partonic k 2
T accessed in the hard scattering reaction can be theoretically achieved either
by utilizing the TMD factorization formalism, where parton distributions themselves depend on kT [42, 52], or by
performing collinear factorization up to higher twist level, in which case the transverse momentum dynamics is
eﬀectively included in multi-parton matrix elements [53].
Remaining in the context of collinear factorization, on can also try to absorb the contributions from the partonic
transverse momentum into a phenomenological HT term to be ﬁtted to the data:
F DIS
T
(xB, Q2) ≈F CF
T
(xB, Q2) + H(xB)/Q2 .
(109)
Given a large enough leverage in Q2, the H(x) coeﬃcient can clearly absorb the diﬀerence between the solid read and
dashed orange curves in, say, Figure 12 and take care of the missing O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2) transverse momentum corrections.
However, a ﬁt to model pseudo-data is needed to establish the accuracy to which PDFs can be extracted given the
still imperfect, and not improvable, estimate of the internal partonic kinematic provided by the ξq scaling variable,
see Figure 9. We leave this phenomenological investigation, as well as a determination of the level to which the DIS
contribution to the lepton-nucleon cross section can be separated from the interference and resonance contributions
discussed in Section III D, to future work [79].

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have revisited QCD factorization with the aim to maximally extending its validity to sub-asymptotic
values of the hard scale Q2, where particle masses and other nonperturbative scales cannot be altogether neglected
as customarily done in the Bjorken limit [23, 48, 55]. We have furthermore validated our ﬁndings by comparing
factorized and analytically calculable structure functions in a spectator model designed to simulate the essential
aspects of lepton-proton scattering in QCD. The focus of this paper has been on inclusive lepton-nucleon observables
as a ﬁrst step towards collinear, and then transverse momentum dependent semi-inclusive scattering processes. The
speciﬁc ﬁndings of our inclusive scattering analysis are many faceted, and it is worthwhile reviewing them in some
detail before closing this paper.
A.
Collinear Factorization in DIS at sub-asymptotic Q2
In the context of inclusive DIS, we have re-derived the QCD factorization formula with the aid of a ﬁnal state
quark jet function, explicitly separating the partonic internal kinematics, which needs to be approximated, from
the hard scattering dynamics, that can be systematically expanded in powers of |kT /Q| and, for light quarks, of
mq/Q. In particular, we have obtained a gauge invariant factorized formula for the leading power (or “leading-twist”)
contribution to the DIS cross section, that in fact coincides with the asymptotic formula evaluated at a rescaled
variable ¯x instead of xB. Using a jet diagram proved essential for the gauge invariance of the result, and no change
in the operator deﬁnition of parton distributions proved necessary.
While our proof has been obtained at LO, a generalization to NLO should not present essential diﬃculties. Indeed,
any diagram at any order can be written as a trace term multiplied by an overall 4-momentum conservation delta
function, as we have done in Eq. (12), thus isolating the part of the cross section in need of kinematic approximation
from the terms in which partonic dynamics comes into play. The latter can be expanded in a power series around
collinear partons, and transverse momentum and parton virtuality contributions are included in higher-twist terms.
Let us stress that this is the central idea of our approach: isolating the kinematics of the external legs of the hard
scattering diagram from the rest, and performing a minimal set of (uncontrolled) approximations only there.
B.
Validation at Leading Twist
Working at leading twist level, the goodness of the kinematic approximations was checked by utilizing a detailed
spectator model calculation, were we could separate the DIS lepton-quark scattering contribution from resonance and
interference contributions. The factorized model transverse function, fully calculable analytically, was the compared
to the exact DIS model calculation.
As shown by the theoretical factorization analysis, the choice of the scaling variable ¯x is arbitrary, in principle, but
can be guided by considering the kinematics of the hard vertex. In particular, using the spectator model, we have
veriﬁed that choosing ¯x = ξq with ξq ≡ξ

one can reproduce the DIS cross section with only a relatively
small overestimation at the large values of xB close to the inelastic scattering kinematic threshold. The variable ξq,
advocated for example in [23, 55] for heavy quark production and adapted here to scattering on light quarks, captures
the kinematic eﬀect of the initial state target mass and of the ﬁnal state quark mass. It is also analogous to the
SIDIS scaling variable ξh = ξ

proposed in [19, 20] and successfully utilized in [21] to incorporate corrections
due to the mass of the observed h hadron in the ﬁnal state. The freedom of rescaling variable choice guaranteed
by our approach has also allowed us to explore the eﬀects of O(µ4/Q4) mass corrections, which are not necessarily
small due to the parton becoming more and more oﬀshell as one approaches the boundary of phase space at large xB.
Fortunately, these corrections turn out to be small for inclusive processes, unless the mass of the quark is increased
beyond the range suitable for our light-quark treatment.
Finally, as already noticed by [48], we have explicitly illustrated an inherent limitation of collinear factorization, that
breaks down at large xB due to the neglect of momentum conservation in the transverse direction. Here, we suggest
that the region in xB and Q2 where this happens might be semi-quantitatively controlled by kinematic considerations,
and in fact a cut in invariant mass of the order of W 2 ≳4 GeV2 might circumscribe the factorization breaking region.
Given that in QCD the excluded region corresponds to resonance excitations, which are outside the scope of the DIS
handbag diagram, such a requirement does not seem to be an unduly restrictive condition.

35
C.
Transverse momentum eﬀects beyond leading twist
The remaining diﬀerence between the CF and full calculation of the transverse structure function is mostly explained
by incorporating the average ⟨k 2
T ⟩in the scaling variable, and considering corrections only up to O(⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2). For
inclusive observables, this study is only possible in the model but we found that the result is stable against variations
of the internal conﬁnement parameter Λ and mass of the target remnant mφ. This strongly suggests that the range of
validity of collinear factorization can be maximized in the large-xB and low-Q2 region by extending the calculations
to twist-4 level, either theoretically (including contributions from multi-parton diagrams) or phenomenologically (by
adding a ﬁtting a H(x)/Q2 term to the LT factorized calculation). A ﬁt of model pseudo-data is under way [79] to
verify if a phenomenological extraction of PDFs can be pushed to as large values of xB as the factorized calculation,
which is still underestimating by ∼10% the values of ⟨x⟩approximated by ξq.
A ﬁner treatment of the partonic transverse momentum can only be obtained in SIDIS processes, where this can
be controlled by a measurement of a ﬁnal state hadron but hadron mass corrections are more complex. Nevertheless,
the results of our paper are very encouraging regarding the procedure advocated in Refs. [20, 21] for SIDIS and in
Ref. [92] for semi-inclusive hadron annihilation in e+ + e−scattering. In those works the scattered quark virtuality
is bound by v ′ 2 ≥m2
h/ζ (with mh the identiﬁed hadron mass and ζ its light-cone fractional momentum) instead of
v ′ 2 ≥m2
q as in the DIS case. It remains an important exercise to perform a model validation for these two cases,
and study the range of validity of collinear factorization for semi-inclusive processes, before extending our analysis to
kinematically more complex case of transverse momentum dependent measurements [39–41].
D.
Beyond Deep Inelastic Scattering
The model used in this study has richer structure than exploited in the validation of collinear factorization of
the cross section’s DIS component. Indeed the model also includes e + p resonant quasi-elastic scattering and the
interference between this and the DIS scattering. (Suitably generalized to higher mass resonances, the model may
thus also prove to be an useful tool in the study of quark-hadron duality [57], potentially allowing one to access PDFs
in lepton-proton scattering processes at even higher xB than currently possible.)
With a gauge-invariant decomposition of the physical process into DIS, resonance and interference processes, we
have shown that the interference and resonance contribution to the transverse FT structure function exhibit an
approximate 1/Q2 and 1/Q4 scaling. Thus one can also envision using model pseudo-data to test how eﬀectively a
phenomenological HT piece can decouple these from the DIS contribution in a PDF ﬁt [79].
The longitudinal FL structure function, instead, is further constrained by gauge invariance and does not exhibit the
strongly ordered power-law scaling observed in the case of FT . Rather, its DIS, resonance and interference components
are all of the same order of magnitude – an eﬀect we traced back to the small-xB behavior of the longitudinal P µν
L
projector. This is therefore a model-independent result and may have a bearing also for a CF analysis of real FL
measurements, with the factorized F CF
L
free to increase as an inverse power of xB at small values of the Bjorken
invariant while the full FL →0 as xB →0. In fact, recent measurements at HERA [81–83] have revealed small-xB
tensions between data and CF calculations, part of which may be explained by our observation. A more detailed CF
analysis of FL at small xB would require a NLO model calculation that is outside of the scope of the present article
but remains an interesting exercise for the future.

Appendix A: Invariant and helicity structure functions, and symmetry constraints at small xB
In Section III A, we discussed how to uniquely decompose a rank-2 tensor, T µν, into a gauge invariant and a gauge
breaking part. The procedure we adopted consists in deﬁning a complete set of orthogonal rank-2 projectors, {P µν
λ },
maximizing the number that satisfy the electromagnetic Ward identity, qµP µν
λ
= 0. For simplicity, in the main text
we focused only on the parity invariant tensors, which are involved in neutral current exchanges such as in the model.
In this appendix we complete that discussion by also consider the parity breaking tensors. We will also examine the
xB →0 limit of the structure functions, completing the analysis initiated in Section III E for the longitudinal FL
structure function.
We can now use the polarization vectors (54) to deﬁne the parity breaking helicity projectors for rank two tensors
as
P µν
A (p, q) = εµ
+(p, q)εν∗
+ (p, q) −εµ
−(p, q)εν∗
−(p, q)
P µν
[LS](p, q) = εµ
0(p, q)εν∗
q (p, q) −εµ
q (p, q)εν∗
0 (p, q).
(A1)
Using
εµ
+(p, q)εν∗
+ (p, q) −εµ
−(p, q)εν∗
−(p, q) =
−iεµναβpαqβ
p
(p · q)2 −p2q2
(A2)
and the explicit polarization vectors deﬁnition (54), the parity breaking projectors can be more compactly written in
“Lorentz” representation as
P µν
A (p, q) = −iεµναβ ˆpαqβ
p
−q2ˆp2
P µν
[LS](p, q) = ˆpµqν −qµˆpν
p
−q2ˆp2
(A3)
where ˆpµ ≡pµ −p·q
q2 qµ. In this form it is easy to verify that these two projectors are orthogonal to each other.
Moreover, the parity breaking projectors are antisymmetric in the indices, and therefore also orthogonal to the parity
invariant projectors (58), that are symmetric in the indices and we report here for reading convenience:
P µν
L (p, q) = ˆpµˆpν
ˆp2
P µν
T (p, q) = −ˆgµν + ˆpµˆpν
ˆp2
P µν
S (p, q) = −qµqν

P µν
{LS}(p, q) = ˆpµqν + qµˆpν
p
−q2ˆp2
,
(A4)
with ˆgµν = gµν −qµqν
q2 . In summary,
Pλ · Pλ′ = 0
for λ ̸= λ′
Pλ · Pλ = 1
for λ = L, S
(A5)
Pλ · Pλ = 2
for λ = T
Pλ · Pλ = −2
for λ = A, {LS}, [LS]
In the Lorentz representation (A3) and (A4), it is easy to convince oneself that these 6 deﬁned projectors are also a
complete orthogonal basis for the space of rank-2 tensors T µν = T µν(p, q) built of the proton and photon momenta p
and q, such as the hadronic tensor for inelastic e + p scattering.
Exploiting the the completeness of this basis, and noticing that the axial projector satisfy the Ward identity,
q · PA ≡qµP µν
A = 0 ,
(A6)
we can extend to the anti-symmetric sector the decomposition (62) of a T µν tensor into a gauge invariant and
maximally gauge breaking piece by deﬁning
T µν = T µν
inv. + T µν

(A9)
The Fλ structure function are deﬁned as in Eq. (60), i.e.,
Fλ(xB, Q2) ≡cλPλ(p, q) · T(p, q) ,
(A10)
but with the index now ranging over the full range λ = L, T, A, S, {LS}, [LS] and cλ = 1/Pλ · Pλ.
As demonstrated in Section III E, it is instructive to study the xB →0 limit of the helicity projectors. Utilizing
ˆpµ →−(p · q/q2)qµ = (1/2xB)qµ and ˆp2 →−(p · q)2/q2 = −q2/(2xB)2, it is easy to see that
P µν

Therefore, all structure functions except FT are constrained at small xB:

xB→0 FS
(A12)
FA −−−−→

(A13)
For gauge conserving interactions, such as electromagnetism, we furthermore ﬁnd that
FL −−−−→
xB→0 0 .
(A14)
An interesting consequence of this constraint, already discussed in Section III E, is that
F DIS
L
−−−−→
xB→0 −F non-DIS

(A15)
which alters the usual scaling expectations based on perturbative arguments, and introduces a novel source of “higher-
twist”, or rather inverse Q2 power corrections. In particular, we have explicitly demonstrated for electromagnetic
interactions in our model that F DIS
L
∝1/Q2 in the small xB limit, see also Appendix D. Let us stress that Eq. (A14)
is purely a consequence of gauge invariance, and therefore we expect this remark to be important for the QCD
interpretation of small-xB measurements of the proton’s FL. Similar considerations also apply to FA and F[LS].

Appendix B: Sub-asymptotic kinematics in detail
We discuss here in some detail the kinematics of the model, and derive a number of bounds on relevant internal
and external variables. Note that the derivation of the bounds does not rely on model peculiarities, nor it is conﬁned
to LO diagrams. A generalization to QCD will also be presented.
1.
Limits on xB
We start by considering the total invariant mass, W 2,
W 2 = (p + q)2 = M 2 + Q2 1
xB
−1

.
(B1)
In the model, by four momentum and lepton number conservation we can write
W 2 ≥(pφ + k′)2 ,
(B2)
where we have exploited the fact that a quark and a meson are the minimal mass ﬁnal state that can be produced in
an inelastic scattering. These particles are asymptotic states of the model, and we can use p2
φ = m2
φ, k′ 2 = m2
q and
pφ · k′ ≥mφmq to derive an upper limit for xB:
xB ≤
1
1 + (mφ+mq)2−M 2
Q2
≡xB,max .
(B3)
The threshold xB,max corresponds to the production of the scattered quark and spectator meson at rest in the target
rest frame. Note that the upper bound can be larger than 1 if the nucleon is unstable, that is, if mφ + mq < M. A
resonance will then appear in the scattering cross section at xB = 1 as shown, for example, in Figure 14.
In QCD, the quark needs to minimally hadronize into a pion, and by baryon number conservation a proton must
also be minimally present in the ﬁnal state. The QCD threshold value can then be obtained from Eq. (B3) substituting
mφ ⇝M and mq ⇝mπ, and is known as the “pion threshold” xπ:
xB|QCD ≤
1
1 + 2mπM+m2π
Q2
≡xπ .
(B4)
The proton in QCD is a stable particle, and the phase space for inelastic scattering is indeed cut oﬀbefore xB|QCD
can reach 1.
2.
Limits on k 2
T
Given a ﬁnite ﬁnal state invariant mass W 2, the transverse momentum squared of the scattered quark is also limited.
To derive its bounds, we consider the center of mass frame, where k′ = −pφ and pφ,T = −k′
T = −kT . Then,
W 2 ≥(p0

Note that solving this for xB when k2
T,max = 0 one recovers the upper limit Eq. (68). This is as it should, since xB,max
corresponds to the production of the recoiled quark and spectator both at rest in the target rest frame.
As with the derivation of xB,max, the transverse momentum bound in QCD can be obtained by substituting mφ ⇝M
and mq ⇝mπ in Eq. (B7).

3.
Internal variables: parton fractional momentum and virtuality
At LO, the unintegrated hadronic tensor contains two delta functions, see Eqs. (51)-(53), which originate from the
upper and lower cuts in the diagrams of Figure 4. These delta functions impose
(k + q)2 −m2
q = 0
(B8)
(p −k)2 −m2
φ = 0
(B9)
and the exact solutions of this system of equations, denoted by xex and k2
ex, enter in the calculation of the kT -
unintegrated hadronic tensor (72). Note that Eqs. (B8) and (B9) are coupled. However, as we already discussed in
the main text, the upper cut (B8) provides the main constraint on the light cone fraction x, since k2 only contributes
to it at next to leading order in 1/Q4 (or rather 1/W 4). The lower cut (B9) then constraints k2 as a function of x.
In order to highlight the role of the W 2 scale in determining the kinematics of the process, we can express the hard
scattering invariant mass, (k + q)2, as
(k + q)2 = W 2 + (k −p)2 + 2(p + q) · (k −p)

therefore interesting to study their expansion in powers of 1/W 2. Using

We do not need to expand k2
ex beyond the leading order because, as mentioned, the parton virtuality plays a role in
the determination of xex only starting at O(1/W 4). In the high-energy W 2 →∞limit (reached, for example, when
xB →0 at ﬁxed Q2, or when Q2 →∞at ﬁxed xB or ξ) one then easily sees that

In other words, the quark’s light-cone momentum fraction becomes independent of the internal partonic kinematics,
while the quark remains oﬀits mass shell at any value of xB (and by quite a large amount if xB ∼1).
A more compact expansion of xex can be obtained in terms of a 1/Q2 instead of 1/W 2 power series, and in terms
of the light-cone virtuality v2

Eq. (B18) coincides with the expansion (76) discussed in the main text, and clearly shows that v2

Appendix C: Resonant scattering in the spectator model
In the main text, we focused on studying the case in which the target, as it also happens for a QCD proton, is a
stable particle and cannot in particular decay into a quark-diquark pair.
For completeness, in Figure 14, we show a calculation of the DIS, resonance and interference contributions to the
structure function FT for a choice of parameters such that mq + mφ < M and the target is no longer stable. A peak
then appears around xB →1 in both the resonance and interference contributions, corresponding to the W 2 →M 2
photon-proton resonant scattering.
When simulating a stable proton in the main text, we chose mq + mφ > M and the peaks were kinematically cut
at xB,max, see Eq. (B3). The result was a small positive bump in the total FT , which should not be mistaken for a
higher mass resonance such as the ∆(1232) in QCD. Nevertheless, it should not be diﬃcult to conceive an extension
of the model that also takes into account such a possibility.

Same as Figure 5 but for a choice of parameters such that mq + mφ < M, which places the kinematic threshold
at xB = xB,max = 1.173. In this case the proton is an unstable particle, and the FT structure function displays a resonance
peak at xB = 1. This corresponds to a W 2 = M 2 four momentum squared exchanged in the s channel, see the diagram (c) in
Figure 4. An analogous divergence can be seen for the interference contribution.

42
Appendix D: Structure function scaling at small xB
In this appendix, we justify from an analytic point of view the Q2 scaling and limiting small-xB behavior observed
numerically in Figures 5 and 6 for the model’s transverse and longitudinal structure functions. Namely, the DIS,
interference and resonance components of the transverse FT are strongly ordered in the photon’s virtuality at all
values of xB, i.e., F DIS
T
∼Q2F INT
T
∼Q4F RES
T
. On the contrary, all components of FL are of order 1/Q2. Moreover,
FL →0 as xB →0, whereas FT shows no smal-xB constraint. As discussed in Appendix A, this behavior of the
longitudinal structure function is a general consequence of gauge invariance, that ties together the components of FL
but leaves FT unconstrained. Nonetheless, it is instructive to see how this explicitly arises from the analytical model
calculations.

T is the Jacobian appearing after rewriting the ﬁnal state delta functions in terms
of xex and k2

We are now interested in studying Eq. (D1) as xB →0 at ﬁxed values of Q2. We will also expand our results in
powers of 1/Q2 as needed. In this limit, we ﬁnd that

Since a factor

additional factors, the Q2 scaling behavior of F (j)
L
is determined by the scaling of xB PL · Tr(j) / Den(j), which we will
study case by case.

as ﬁrst observed numerically in Figure 5. Note that this logarithmic term term is a direct consequence of the choice of
dipole form factor used to simulate conﬁnement; had we used an exponential form factor the resonance contribution
would have followed the naive expectation.

Appendix E: Model systematics
In Secs. IV and V we tested the kinematic approximation and investigated the region of validity of collinear
factorization for a selection of representative values of the target mass M and the quark mq, both “external” parameters
of the model. In this Appendix, complete the analysis of the systematics of the model results, by also varying the
“internal” parameters of the model, which mimic physics that can not be experimentally controlled in DIS: the
conﬁnement scale Λ, and the proton remnant mass modeled by the spectator mass mφ ∼⟨mX⟩. The results are
presented, in Figures 15-18, that share the same structure:
• the central panel corresponds to the default model parameters, determined by a ﬁt of the model PDF to the quark
PDFs of QCD phenomenologically ﬁtted to experimental data as discussed in Section III, and the parameters
are varied one by one in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, respectively;
• the horizontal and vertical rows show the variation of the spectator mass mφ, and conﬁnement scale Λ, respec-
tively;
• the two diagonal rows show variations of the external target mass M and quark mass mq.
The plots in Figure 15 show the behavior of ⟨k 2
T ⟩as a function of xB. As expected, ⟨k 2
T ⟩≈O(Λ2) is not a priori
negligible compared to the target and quark squared masses, M 2 and m2
q.
In Figure 16, we present a comparison between the average light-cone virtuality in the DIS process compared to
the ¯v 2 = 0, ¯v 2 = ¯v 2
∗[Eq. (45)], and ¯v 2 = ¯v 2
∗T [Eq. (95)] approximations. Claerly, the last two approximate ⟨v2⟩
at large x better. However, the light-cone virtuality only contributes at O(1/Q4) to the determination of the struck
quark momentum fraction, see for example Eq. (32), and these non-zero choices for ¯v 2 have a minor impact on the
calculation of the CF structure functions (see also below).
In Figure 17, we compare the average light-cone fraction ⟨x⟩to the collinear choices collected in Table I. As
already discussed in Section IV B, the choice ¯x = xB approximation provides an inaccurate description of the parton’s
longitudinal kinematics, while x = ξq describes ∼95% of the light-cone fraction, with only minor improvements
obtained when including non-zero virtuality O(1/Q4) corrections in ¯x = ξ∗
q. Only keeping into account the partonic
transverse dynamics through ⟨k 2
T ⟩/Q2 corrections in ¯x = ξq can one obtain a fully accurate approximation.
Finally, in Figure 18 we show the ratio of the collinear structure functions to the exact one. This plots illustrate
that the conclusions made from Figure 11 are not very sensitive to the variation of Λ and mφ: a factorized calcula-
tion utilizing ¯x = ξq provides nearly the best possible description of the full DIS structure function achievable only
considering external variables, and the quality of this approximation is independent of the value of the internal (un-
observable) model parameters. Taking into consideration the transverse momentum dynamics allows one to maximize
the kinematic range of validity of the CF calculation before this unavoidably breaks down due to neglect of momentum
conservation.
In Table III we present for all cases discussed in this Appendix the xB,break factorization breaking thresholds, and the
corresponding invariant mass value. We also present the corresponding Rbreak relative contribution of the k 2
T > k2
T,max
tails to the factorized FT structure function. As a rough summary, factorization breaks down at W 2 ≲4 GeV2, which
is when 20% or more of the CF structure functions originates from k 2
T values beyond the kinematic k2
T,max threshold
imposed by four momentum conservation.
