In recent years, there have been significant efforts on mitigating unethical demographic biases in machine learning methods. However, very little is done for kernel methods. In this paper, we propose a new fair kernel regression method via fair feature embedding (FKR-F$^2$E) in kernel space. Motivated by prior works on feature selection in kernel space and feature processing for fair machine learning, we propose to learn fair feature embedding functions that minimize demographic discrepancy of feature distributions in kernel space. Compared to the state-of-the-art fair kernel regression method and several baseline methods, we show FKR-F$^2$E achieves significantly lower prediction disparity across three real-world data sets.
