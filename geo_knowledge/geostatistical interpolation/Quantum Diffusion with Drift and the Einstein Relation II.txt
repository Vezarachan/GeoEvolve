Abstract:
This paper is a companion to [3]. Its purpose is to describe and prove a certain number of technical results used in [3],
but not proven there. Both papers concern long-time properties (diﬀusion, drift) of the motion of a driven quantum particle coupled
to an array of thermal reservoirs. The main technical results derived in the present paper are (1) an asymptotic perturbation theory
applicable for small driving, and, (2) the construction of time-dependent correlation functions of particle observables.
KEY WORDS: diﬀusion, kinetic limit, quantum brownian motion
1. Introduction
In [3] and in the present paper, we study a model of a quantum tracer particle hopping on the lattice Zd (d ≥1)
and interacting with an array of thermal reservoirs placed at the sites of Zd, which are described quantum-
mechanically: When the particle visits a site x ∈Zd it can emit or absorb quanta of the thermal reservoir
at site x, thus changing its own momentum. Those quanta correspond to non-interacting, massless modes –
phonons or photons – in a state of thermal equilibrium at a positive temperature T = β−1, the same for all the
reservoirs. Reservoirs at diﬀerent sites are independent of one another. As a consequence, memory eﬀects only
arise when the particle returns to sites it has visited previously. At positive temperature and assuming a certain
analyticity property of the particle-reservoir coupling, such memory eﬀects turn out to decay exponentially fast
in time. There is a constant external force acting on the tracer particle. The particular model described here has
ﬁrst been studied in [8], for a vanishing external force, and it has been proven there that the particle exhibits
“quantum Brownian motion”; (see also [2, 5] for related results). The purpose of the analysis presented in [3]
and in this paper is to determine asymptotic properties of the motion of the particle in the presence of a non-
vanishing external force, as time t tends to ∞. As announced in [3], one expects that, for a suﬃciently weak
external force and weak particle-reservoir interactions, the state of the quantum particle (that is, a state on the
algebra generated by functions of its momentum) approaches a “non-equilibrium steady state” (NESS). This state
describes a uniform motion of the tracer particle with a mean drift velocity v that depends on the force pushing it,
the strength of interaction of the particle with the reservoirs and the temperature of the reservoirs. Furthermore,

the particle exhibits diﬀusion – “quantum Brownian motion” – around its mean motion. The diﬀusion constant
at zero force is related to the derivative, at zero external force, of the drift velocity with respect to the force by
the Einstein relation.
One major diﬃculty encountered in our analysis is that, for a non-zero external force, the state of the particle
(a density matrix on the particle Hilbert space obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of all the reservoirs)
appears to show phase coherence over fairly long distance scales. In contrast, when the external force vanishes,
the state of the particle exhibits exponential decoherence in particle position space.
Because of the lack of
decoherence in the presence of an external force our result concerning the approach of the particle state to a
NESS only holds in an ergodic mean, and our formula for the diﬀusion constant involves an abelian limit.
While the material in [3] is quite elegant and of some general conceptual interest, the present paper is primarily
technical. Most technicalities to be coped with in the following are related to the thermodynamic limit and to
the need to control large-time asymptotics, in particular cluster properties of connected correlation functions of
particle observables, as time diﬀerences tend to ∞. The need to introduce ﬁnite-volume approximations of the
system studied in our papers comes from the structure of our proof of the Einstein relation. Technical diﬃculties
arise because the components of the particle position are unbounded operators and the potential of a constant
force grows linearly in the particle position.
Background from physics and an account of the diﬃculties encountered in the analysis of this and of more
realistic models of quantum transport have been presented in [3] and will not be repeated here. Suﬃce it to
say that we expect that one would face major problems if one attempted to extend the results of [3] and of the
present paper to more realistic models of particle transport – in particular, continuum models – or if one tried
to prove stronger convergence results for the model studied here.
The organization of our paper is as follows:
In Section 2, we recall some notation and the deﬁnition of the model studied in [3] and in this paper. We then
deﬁne the eﬀective quantum dynamics of the particle, after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the thermal
reservoirs, and we introduce correlation (Green) functions of operators representing properties of the particle
(particle observables) in various states of the system. We deﬁne the time-reversal operator and recall the KMS
condition characterizing a thermal equilibrium state. Equilibrium states at vanishing external force appear in
our proof of the Einstein relations.
In Section 3, the main assumptions concerning our model are summarized, and the main results proven in [3]
and in this paper are stated. All results are only proven for a weak external force and at weak coupling of the tracer
particle to the reservoirs, (where “weak” depends on the temperature of the reservoirs and the kinetic energy
operator of the particle). In Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we state our results on the existence and some properties of the
thermodynamic limit. Theorem 3.3 describes “return to equilibrium” at vanishing external force. Theorem 3.4
concerns the approach, in an ergodic mean, of the state of the tracer particle to a “non-equilibrium stationary (or
steady) state” (NESS). In Theorem 3.5, the convergence of the mean velocity of the particle to a non-zero drift
velocity, as time t tends to ∞, is asserted, and a formula for the diﬀusion constant involving an abelian limit is
presented. The Einstein relation forms the content of Theorem 3.6.
In Section 4, the Dyson expansion of the propagator describing the time-evolution of general mixed states
of the system in powers of the operator describing the interactions between the particle and the reservoirs is
derived. This expansion also yields an expansion of the eﬀective particle dynamics and of correlation functions of
particle observables when the degrees of freedom of the reservoirs are traced out; (Subsections 4.2 through 4.4).
In Subsection 4.5, the Dyson expansions are cast in the form of “polymer expansions” for dilute gases of extended
particles with hard-core interactions contained in a one-dimensional “space”, with “space” corresponding to the
time axis of the original system.
In Section 5, the expansions derived in Section 4 are further studied and used to prove existence and properties
of the thermodynamic limit of various quantities; see Subsection 5.1.
(These results can be used to prove
Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2.) In Subsection 5.2, bounds on the eﬀective dynamics of the tracer particle, after tracing out
the reservoir degrees of freedom, are proven. In Subsection 5.3, the Laplace transform in the time variable of the
eﬀective particle dynamics is introduced, yielding an object resembling a resolvent of an eﬀective Hamiltonian
that depends on a spectral parameter with the interpretation of an energy. This “pseudo-resolvent” plays a
fundamental role in the proofs of the main results stated in Section 3. In Subsection 5.4, a direct-integral (ﬁber-
momentum) decomposition of translation-invariant operators acting on the particle state and in particular of the
eﬀective particle dynamics is recalled. In Subsection 5.5, the main contributions, in ﬁbers of ﬁxed momentum,
to the pseudo-resolvents introduced in Subsection 5.3 are identiﬁed, and some key spectral properties of these
operators are described; (but see also [3]).
2

In Section 6, the behavior of the “pseudo-resolvents” near the origin of the complex spectral parameter plane
(“zero energy”) is analyzed, which yields information on large-time asymptotics of the eﬀective dynamics.
In Section 7, the eﬀective dynamics and the correlation functions are studied for a particle in a vanishing
external force.
In this situation, the state of the system (restricted to continuous functions of the particle
momentum operator) is shown to approach an equilibrium state at the temperature of the reservoirs. This yields
a proof of Theorem 3.3.
In Section 8, the Einstein relation (Theorem 3.6) is proven.
All other results, in particular Theorems 3.4 and 3.5, have already been proven in the companion paper [3],
using the results established in Sects. 5 and 6 of this paper. In order to render the present paper comprehensible
and more or less self-contained, it is unavoidable to repeat a certain amount of material concerning deﬁnitions
and notation from [3]. The reader is recommended to consult the companion paper [3] for background from
physics, motivation and discussion of the main results.

2. Definition of the model
In this section, we recall the deﬁnition of the model studied in [3] and in this paper in a ﬁnite volume approx-
imation. Among other things, we also repeat some important notations and conventions, the deﬁnition of the
reservoir equilibrium states and the deﬁnition of the eﬀective particle dynamics.
2.1. Notations and conventions.
2.1.1. Banach spaces. Given a Hilbert space E , we use the standard notation
Bp(E ) :=
n
A ∈B(E ) : Tr
h
(A∗A)p/2i
< ∞
o
,
1 ≤p ≤∞,
with B∞(E ) ≡B(E ) the bounded operators on E , and
∥A∥p :=

Tr
h
(A∗A)p/2i1/p
,
∥A∥:= ∥A∥∞.
For operators acting on Bp(E ), e.g., elements of B(Bp(E )), we often use the calligraphic font: V, W etc.. An
operator A ∈B(E ) determines bounded operators Ad(A) , ad(A) , Al , Ar on Bp(E ) by
Ad(A)B := ABA∗,
ad(A)B := [A, B] = AB −BA
and
AlB := AB ,
ArB := BA∗,
B ∈Bp(E ) .
(2.1)
Note that (A1)l(A2)r = (A2)r(A1)l, as operators on Bp(E ), A1, A2 ∈B(E ), i.e., the left- and right multiplications
commute. The norm of operators in B(Bp(E )) is deﬁned by
∥W∥:=
sup
A∈Bp(E )
∥W(A)∥p
∥A∥p
.
In the following, we usually set p = 1 or 2.
2.1.2. Scalar products. For vectors κ ∈Cd, we let Re κ denote the vector (Re κ1, . . . , Re κd), where Re denotes
the real part. Similar notation is used for the imaginary part, Im. The scalar product on Cd is written as (κ1, κ2)
or κ1 · κ2 and the norm as |κ| :=
p
(κ, κ). The scalar product on an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space E is
written as ⟨· , ·⟩, or, occasionally, as ⟨· , ·⟩E . All scalar products are deﬁned to be linear in the second argument
and anti-linear in the ﬁrst one.
3

2.1.3. Kernels. For E = ℓ2(Zd), we can represent A ∈B2(E ) by its kernel A(x, y), i.e., (Af)(x) = P
y A(x, y)f(y),
f ∈E . Similarly, an operator, A, acting on B2(E ) can be represented by its kernel A(x, y, x′, y′) satisfying
(Aρ)(x, y) = P
x′,y′ A(x, y, x′, y′)ρ(x′, y′), ρ ∈B2(E ). Occasionally, we use the notation |x⟩for δx ∈E , deﬁned
by δx(x′) = δx,x′, and ⟨x| for ⟨δx , · ⟩. In this notation |x⟩⟨y| stands for the rank-one operator δx ⟨δy , · ⟩. Similarly,
for the choice E = L2(Td), we often use the notation |f⟩for f ∈L2(Td) and ⟨g| for ⟨g, · ⟩, g ∈L2(Td). In this
‘Dirac notation’, |f⟩⟨g| stands for the rank-one operator f⟨g, · ⟩on L2(Td).
2.2. The particle.Consider the hypercube Λ = ΛL = Zd ∩[−L/2, L/2]d, for some L ∈2N. The particle Hilbert
space is chosen as HS = ℓ2(Λ) where the subscript S refers to ‘system’.
To describe the hopping term (kinetic energy), we choose a real function ε : Td →R and we consider the
self-adjoint operator T ≡T Λ on ℓ2(Λ) with symmetric kernel1
T (x, x′) = ˆε(x −x′) ,
with ˆε the Fourier transform of ε. Since we will assume ε to be analytic, the hopping is short range.
A natural choice for the dispersion law is ε(k) = P
j 2(1 −cos kj), corresponding to T = −∆, with ∆the
lattice Laplacian on ℓ2(Λ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This choice satisﬁes all our assumptions, to be
stated in Section 3.1.
We deﬁne the particle Hamiltonian as
HS := T −F · X ,
where F ∈Rd is an external force ﬁeld, e.g., an electric ﬁeld, and X ≡XΛ denotes the position operator on HS,
deﬁned by Xf(x) = xf(x). In what follows we will write F = λ2χ, with χ a rescaled ﬁeld, (a notation to be
motivated later).
2.3. The reservoir.
2.3.1. Dynamics. For each x ∈Zd, we deﬁne a reservoir Hilbert space at site x by
HRx := Γs(L2(¯Λ)) ,
where ¯Λ = ¯ΛL = Rd ∩[−L/2, L/2]d and Γs(E) is the symmetric (bosonic) Fock space over the Hilbert space E.
We assume that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of second quantization, such as Fock space and
creation/annihilation operators; (we refer to, e.g., [4] for deﬁnitions and background). The total reservoir Hilbert
space is deﬁned by
HR :=
O
x∈Λ
HRx .
Note that for all x, the spaces HRx are isomorphic to each other. We remark that there is no compelling reason
to restrict the one-site reservoirs to the same region, [−L/2, L/2]d, as the particle system, but this simpliﬁes our
notation. The reservoir Hamiltonian is deﬁned as
HR :=
X
x∈Λ
X
q∈¯Λ∗
ω(q)a∗
x,qax,q ,
(2.3)
where ¯Λ∗= 2π
L Zd is the set of quasi-momenta for the reservoir at site x, and the operators a#
x,q are the canonical
creation/annihilation operators satisfying the commutation relations
[ax,q, a∗
x′,q′] = δx,x′δq,q′ ,
[ax,q, ax′,q′] = [a∗
x,q, a∗
x′,q′] = 0 ,
and we choose the dispersion law ω(q) = |q| + δq,0.
Note that this dispersion law corresponds to photons
or phonons, except for q = 0, where we have modiﬁed this dispersion law at q = 0 by adding an infrared
regularization that does not aﬀect any of our results; e.g., if we replace δ0,q by Kδ0,q, with K > 0, then all
inﬁnite-volume objects studied in this paper are independent of K.
1 Later, we will consider T Λ as an operator on ℓ2(Zd) by the natural embedding of ℓ2(Λ) into ℓ2(Zd). As such, it has the kernel
T Λ(x, x′) =
(
ˆǫ(x −x′) ,
if
x, x′ ∈Λ
0
else
,
(2.2)
i.e., we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions.
4

2.3.2. Equilibrium state. Next, we introduce the Gibbs state of the reservoir at inverse temperature β, 0 < β < ∞.
It is given by the density matrix
ρR,β :=
1
ZR,β
e−βHR ,
where
ZR,β = TrR[e−βHR] ,
(2.4)
where TrR denotes the trace over HR.
An alternative way to describe this density matrix is to specify the expectation values of arbitrary observables,
which we denote by ⟨O⟩ρR,β := Tr [OρR,β]. For ϕ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗), we write ax(ϕ) = P
q∈¯Λ∗ϕ(q)ax,q, and we choose
observables, O, to be polynomials in the operators ax(ϕ). One then ﬁnds that, for any x, x′ and ϕ, ϕ′ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗):
i. Gauge-invariance:
⟨a∗
x(ϕ)⟩ρR,β = ⟨ax(ϕ)⟩ρR,β = 0 ;
(2.5)
ii. Two-point correlations: Let ̺β := (eβω −1)−1, with the one-particle dispersion law ω(q) = |q| + δq,0, be the
Bose-Einstein density (operator). Then
 
⟨a∗
x(ϕ)ax′(ϕ′)⟩ρR,β
⟨a∗
x(ϕ)a∗
x′(ϕ′)⟩ρR,β
⟨ax(ϕ)ax′(ϕ′)⟩ρR,β

iii. Wick’s theorem:

(2.6)
⟨a#
x2n+1(ϕ2n+1) . . . a#
1 (ϕ1)⟩ρR,β = 0 ,
(2.7)
where Pair(n) denotes the set of partitions of {1, . . . , 2n} into n pairs and the product is over these pairs
(r, s), with the convention that r < s. Here, # stands either for ∗or nothing.
2.4. The interaction.We deﬁne the Hilbert space of state vectors of the coupled system (particle and reservoirs)
by
H := HS ⊗HR .
We pick a smooth ‘structure factor’ φ ∈L2(Rd) and we deﬁne its ﬁnite volume version φΛ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗) by
φΛ(q) = (2π/L)d/2φ(q), with the normalization chosen such that ∥φ∥L2(Rd) =
lim
L→∞∥φΛ∥ℓ2(¯Λ∗).
We will drop
the superscript Λ. The interaction between the particle and the reservoir at site x is given by
1x ⊗Ψx(φ),
where
Ψx(φ) = ax(φ) + a∗
x(φ)
is the ﬁeld operator, and
1x = |x⟩⟨x| denotes the projection onto the lattice site x. The interaction Hamiltonian
is taken to be
HSR :=
X
x∈Λ
1x ⊗Ψx(φ)
on
HS ⊗HR .
The total Hamiltonian of the interacting system on H is then given by
H := T ⊗
1 −λ2χ · X ⊗
1 +
1 ⊗HR + λHSR ,
(2.8)
where λ ∈R is a coupling constant. The interaction term HSR is relatively bounded w.r.t. HS+HR with arbitrarily
small relative bound. It follows that H is essentially selfadjoint on the domain HS ⊗Dom(HR), (where Dom(HR)
denotes the domain of HR).
5

2.5. Eﬀective dynamics and correlation functions. The time-evolution in the Schr¨odinger picture is given
by
ρt = e−itHρ eitH ,
ρ ∈B1(H ) .
We will ﬁrst choose an initial state ρ of the form ρ = ρS ⊗ρR,β, with ρR,β as deﬁned above. Of course, ρt, with
t > 0, will in general not be a simple tensor product, but we can always take the partial trace, TrR[ · ], over HR
to obtain the ‘reduced density matrix’ ρS,t of the system;
ρS,t = TrR

e−itH(ρS ⊗ρR,β)eitH
=: Z[0,t]ρS ,
and we call Z[0,t] : B1(HS) →B1(HS) : ρS 7→ρS,t the reduced or eﬀective dynamics. It is a trace-preserving and
completely positive map.
In the present paper, we will mainly consider observables of the form O ⊗
1 with O ∈B(HS), in which case
we can also write
⟨O(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := Tr[O(t)ρS ⊗ρR,β] = TrS[OρS,t] ,
(2.9)
where the trace Tr[ · ] is over the Hilbert space H , the trace TrS[ · ] is over the particle Hilbert space HS and O(t)
is the Heisenberg picture time evolution of the observable O ⊗
1, i.e.,
O(t) := eitH(O ⊗
1) e−itH .
(2.10)
Note that O(t) is, in general, not of the product form O′ ⊗
1, for some O′.
Next, consider several observables O1, . . . , Om ∈B(H ) and a set of times t1, . . . , tm ∈R. For ρS ∈B1(HS)
we deﬁne correlation functions by the formula
⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := Tr[Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)(ρS ⊗ρR,β)] ,
(2.11)
the trace being over the Hilbert space H .
2.5.1. Equilibrium states. Apart from an initial state (density matrix) of the product form ρS ⊗ρR,β, we also
consider the Gibbs state of the coupled system when the external force ﬁeld vanishes, χ = 0. In ﬁnite volume, it
is deﬁned by
ρβ := 1
Zβ
e−βHχ=0,
Zβ = Tr e−βHχ=0,
Hχ=0 = T ⊗
1 +
1 ⊗HR + λHSR ,
and one easily checks that ρβ ∈B1(H ). The correlation functions determined by ρβ are written as
⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρβ := Tr[Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)ρβ] ,
with O1, . . . , Om and t1, . . . , tm as in (2.11).
2.5.2. Time-reversal. We deﬁne an anti-linear time-reversal operator Θ = ΘS ⊗ΘR, where ΘS is given by
ΘSf(x) = f(x) ,
f ∈ℓ2(Λ) ,
and ΘR by ΘR := Γs(θR), with the one-particle operator θR given by
θRϕx(q) = ϕx(−q) ,
ϕx ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗) ,
x ∈Λ .
If the dispersion law ε of the particle and the form factor φ are invariant under time-reversal, i.e., ε(k) = ε(−k),
φ(q) = φ(−q) (as will be assumed) then we have that
ΘHχ=0Θ = Hχ=0,
ΘρβΘ = ρβ ,
expressing time-reversal invariance of the model.
6

2.5.3. KMS condition. The KMS condition characterizing the Gibbs state ρβ can be expressed as follows: Denote
by Hβ the strip
Hβ := {z ∈C : 0 ≤Im z ≤β} .
(2.12)
Then, for O1, O2 ∈B(H ), the correlation function z 7→⟨Oχ=0
2
(z)O1⟩ρβ is analytic in the interior of the strip Hβ,
bounded and continuous on Hβ, and satisﬁes the KMS (boundary) condition
⟨Oχ=0
2
(t)O1⟩ρR,β = ⟨O1Oχ=0
2
(t + iβ)⟩ρR,β ,
t ∈R .
(2.13)
This follows from the cyclicity of the trace. Note that we write Oχ=0(t) to indicate that, here, the time evolution
is generated by Hχ=0.
3. Assumptions and Results
3.1. Assumptions.The model introduced in the last section is parametrized by two functions: the dispersion
law ε : Td →R, and the form factor φ : Rd →C. In this subsection, we formulate our assumptions on these two
functions. The (multi-) strip Vδ is deﬁned by
Vδ := {z ∈(T + iT)d : | Im z| ≤δ} .
(3.1)
Assumption A.
[Particle dispersion] The function ε extends to an analytic function in a region containing a
strip Vδ, δ > 0. In particular, the norm
∥ε∥∞,δ := sup
p∈Vδ
|ε(p)|
is ﬁnite, for some δ > 0. Furthermore, there does not exist any v ∈Rd such that the function
Td ∋k 7→(v, ∇ε(k))
vanishes identically.
This assumption allows us to estimate the free particle propagator e−itHS on the particle Hilbert space
HS = ℓ2(ΛL) as follows:
 e−itHS
(x, x′)
 ≤Ce−ν|x−x′|et∥Im ε∥∞,ν .
(3.2)
For L = ∞, the bound (3.2) is the Combes-Thomas bound; for ﬁnite L, it can be established in an analogous
way. If we replace Zd by Rd, any physically acceptable dispersion law ε is unbounded, and there is no exponential
decay in |x −x′|. This is the main reason why the system studied in this paper is deﬁned on a lattice.
The next assumption deals with the ‘time-dependent’ correlation function deﬁned (in ﬁnite-volume) as
ˆψΛ(t) :=
X
q∈¯Λ∗
|φΛ(q)|2
 e−itω(q)
eβω(q) −1 +
eitω(q)
1 −e−βω(q)

,
(3.3)
and in the thermodynamic limit as
ˆψ(t) :=
Z
dq |φ(q)|2
 e−it|q|
eβ|q| −1 +
eit|q|
1 −e−β|q|

.
(3.4)
Since the correlation function ˆψ is determined by the form factor φ, the following assumption is in fact a constraint
on the choice of φ.
Assumption B. [Decay of reservoir correlation function] The form factor φ is a spherically symmetric function,
i.e., φ(q) =: φ(|q|). The correlation functions ˆψΛ(z), ˆψ(z) are uniformly bounded in Λ and z ∈Hβ, (see (2.12)),
and
limΛ ˆψΛ(z) = ˆψ(z)
7

holds uniformly on compacts in Hβ, where limΛ stands for limL→∞(recall that Λ ≡ΛL). Furthermore, the
number
X
q∈¯Λ∗
ω(q)−1|φΛ(q)|2
(3.5)
is bounded uniformly in Λ. Most importantly, ˆψ(z) is continuous on Hβ and
| ˆψ(z)| ≤C e−gR|z| ,
z ∈Hβ .
This assumption entails that the reservoirs exhibit exponential loss of memory. This is a key ingredient for
our analysis.
Often, one also considers the ‘spectral density’
ψ(ω) = 1
2π
Z ∞
−∞
dt ˆψ(t) eitω .
(3.6)
It satisﬁes the so-called ‘detailed balance’ property eβωψ(ω) = ψ(−ω), which expresses, physically, that the
reservoir is in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature β.
Assumptions A and B are henceforth required and will not be repeated.
3.2. Thermodynamic limit.Up to this point, we have considered a system in a ﬁnite volume (cube), Λ or ¯Λ,
characterized by its linear size L. However, if we wish to study dissipative eﬀects, we must, of course, pass to
the thermodynamic limit, in order to eliminate ﬁnite-volume eﬀects such as Poincar´e recurrence. This amounts
to taking Λ = Zd, ¯Λ = Rd and is accomplished below.
In this section, we will explicitly put a label Λ on all quantities referring to a system in a ﬁnite volume.
As an example, HS now stands for ℓ2(Zd), and we write H Λ
S
for ℓ2(Λ). The shorthand limΛ stands for the
thermodynamic limit, limL→∞.
3.2.1. Observables of the system.We begin by deﬁning some classes of inﬁnite-volume system observables, (i.e.,
certain types of bounded operators on HS). We say that an operator O ∈B(HS) is exponentially localized
whenever
|O(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x|+|x′|),
for some ν > 0 .
An important rˆole is played by the so-called quasi-diagonal operators. These are operators O ∈B(HS) with the
property that
|O(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x−x′|),
for some ν > 0 .
We denote by
◦
A the class of quasi-diagonal operators and by A its norm-closure.
An observable O ∈B(HS) is said to be translation-invariant whenever TyO = O, for arbitrary y ∈Zd, where
TyO(x, x′) := O(x + y, x′ + y). Translation-invariant operators on HS form a commutative C∗-algebra denoted
by Cti. We also introduce the algebras
◦
Ati := Cti ∩
◦
A ,
Ati := Cti ∩A .
An operator O ∈Cti/
◦
Ati/Ati can be identiﬁed with a multiplication operator, Mf, on the Hilbert space L2(Td),
i.e., Mfg = fg, g ∈L2(Td), with f : Td 7→C a bounded and measurable/real-analytic/continuous function.
Physically, the variable in Td is the momentum of the particle.
These classes of operators are introduced because certain expansions used in our analysis will apply to quasi-
diagonal operators or translation-invariant quasi-diagonal operators, and they can be extended to the closures of
these algebras by density.
In analyzing diﬀusion and in the proof of the Einstein relation we also need to consider certain observables
that are unbounded operators: We introduce the ∗-algebra X that consists of polynomials in the components, Xi,
i = 1, . . . , d, of the particle-position operator X.
Given an inﬁnite-volume observable O ∈B(HS), HS = ℓ2(Zd), or O ∈X, we associate an observable
OΛ =
1ΛO
1Λ on H Λ
S = ℓ2(Λ) with it, where
1Λ is the orthogonal projection ℓ2(Zd) →ℓ2(Λ).

3.2.2. Dynamics.
We choose not to construct directly the time-evolution of inﬁnite-volume observables and
inﬁnite-volume states, although this could be done by using the Araki-Woods representation of the system in
the thermodynamic limit. Instead, we will analyze the inﬁnite-volume dynamics of ‘reduced’ states, i.e., of states
restricted to particle observables and correlation (Green) functions of particle-observables by constructing these
objects as thermodynamic limits of ﬁnite-volume expressions.
An inﬁnite-volume density matrix of the particle system ρS ∈B1(HS) is called exponentially localized if
|ρS(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x|+|x′|) ,
for some ν > 0 .
(3.7)
Given such an inﬁnite-volume density matrix ρS, we associate ﬁnite-volume density matrices
ρΛ
S :=
1
ZΛ
ρS
1ΛρS
1Λ ∈B1(H Λ
S ) ,
ZΛ
ρS := TrS[1ΛρS
1Λ] ,
(3.8)
with it. Note that, due to the normalization by ZΛ
ρS, ρΛ
S is a density matrix on H Λ
S .
Recall the deﬁnition of the reduced dynamics, ZΛ
[0,t], introduced in Section 2.5. We set
Z[0,t]ρS := limΛZΛ
[0,t]ρΛ
S .
(3.9)
The next lemma asserts that the thermodynamic limit (as Λ and ¯Λ increase to Zd, Rd, respectively) in (3.9)
exists, and that the resulting reduced dynamics Z[0,t] is translation-invariant.
Lemma 3.1. The limit on the right side of Equation (3.9) exists in B1(HS), and this deﬁnes the map Z[0,t] :
B1(HS) →B1(HS). The map Z[0,t] preserves the trace, i.e., TrS[Z[0,t]ρS] = TrS[ρS], positivity and exponential
localization of the state of the particle, i.e., if ρS has any of these properties, then so does Z[0,t]ρS. Moreover,
Z[0,t] is translation-invariant; T−yZ[0,t]Ty = Z[0,t] for y ∈Zd with Ty as in Subsection 3.2.1. As a consequence
of the above, for O in A or X, and for an exponentially localized state ρS, we can deﬁne
⟨O(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := TrS[OZ[0,t]ρS] .
3.2.3. Correlation functions. Next, we deﬁne the inﬁnite-volume analogues of the ﬁnite-volume correlation func-
tions
⟨OΛ
m(tm) · · · OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
β
and
⟨OΛ
m(tm) · · · OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
S ⊗ρΛ
R,β
that have been introduced in Section 2.5.
Consider observables O1, . . . , Om in A or X, times 0 ≤t1 < . . . < tm, and an exponentially localized density
matrix ρS. We then deﬁne
⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := limΛ⟨OΛ
m(tm) · · · OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
S ⊗ρΛ
R,β .
(3.10)
Similarly, for observables O1, . . . , Om ∈Ati and times 0 ≤t1 < . . . < tm, we deﬁne
⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρβ := limΛ⟨OΛ
m(tm) · · · OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
β .
(3.11)
Note that we construct the thermodynamic limit of equilibrium correlation functions only for translation-invariant
observables, since, pictorially, the particle is uniformly distributed in space and hence the expectation values of
localized observables vanish. Also note that, in Equation (3.11), we do not constrain the time-evolution to be
the one generated by the Hamiltonian with χ = 0. But, of course, we have to do so if we want the correlation
functions to be stationary in time, as in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. The limits on the right hand sides of Equations (3.10) and (3.11) exist. For m = 1, 2, they exist for
t1, t2 ∈R (i.e., not necessarily positive or ordered). For the dynamics with χ = 0, and for arbitrary observables
O1, O2 ∈Ati, writing O(t), instead of Oχ=0(t), and OΘ, instead of ΘSOΘS, the following properties hold:
i. Stationarity: ⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ = ⟨O2(t2 + t)O1(t1 + t)⟩ρβ, for any t ∈R;
ii. Time-reversal invariance: ⟨O2,Θ(−t2)O1,Θ(−t1)⟩ρβ = ⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ;
9

iii. KMS condition: There exists a function z 7→fO1,O2(z), analytic in the interior of the strip Hβ, bounded
and continuous on Hβ, that satisﬁes the KMS (boundary) condition
fO1,O2(t) := ⟨O2O1(t)⟩ρβ,
fO1,O2(t + iβ) = ⟨O1(t)O2⟩ρβ ,
t ∈R .
We remark that there is no particular reason to limit our construction of general correlation functions to one-
and two-point functions, m = 1, 2. However, focusing on these special cases will enable us to keep our notation
manageable in the technical sections. Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 are proven in Section 5, using rather straightforward
estimates. These are the only ones among our results that do not require exponential decay of the reservoir
correlation function ˆψ (cf. Assumption B), nor small coupling, λ, or weak external ﬁeld, χ.
3.3. Results.Next, we summarize our main results. Throughout this section, it is understood that we consider
the inﬁnite-volume system; i.e., Λ = Zd, ¯Λ = Rd.
Theorem 3.3 concerns the system in equilibrium, i.e., in a vanishing external force ﬁeld, and asserts that, in
this case, the system has the property of ‘return to equilibrium’. Theorem 3.4 states the corresponding result
for an oﬀ-equilibrium system: It claims that the state of the system approaches, for small external force ﬁelds χ,
a ‘Non-Equilibrium Stationary State’ (NESS) in the limit of large times. Theorem 3.5 asserts that the motion
of the particle is diﬀusive at large times. For χ ̸= 0, this diﬀusive motion is around an average uniform motion
(i.e., a drift at a constant velocity). Our last result, Theorem 3.6, conﬁrms the ﬂuctuation-dissipation formula
of linear response theory: The equilibrium (χ = 0) diﬀusion matrix is related to the response of the particle’s
motion to the ﬁeld χ through the ‘Einstein relation’.
Theorems 3.4 and 3.5 have already appeared in [3], (see Theorems 3.2 and 3.3). We restate them here for
completeness. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove Theorems 3.3 and 3.6, besides developing
analytical techniques and establishing technical results that have been used to prove various results in [3].
Our ﬁrst result (partially contained in [8]) concerns the model without external force ﬁeld, i.e., χ = 0.
Theorem 3.3. [Return to equilibrium] Let χ = 0. Then there exist a constant kλ > 0 and a decay rate g > 0 such
that, for 0 < |λ| < kλ, the following holds. For an arbitrary exponentially localized density matrix ρS, arbitrary
observables O1, . . . , Om ∈Ati and times 0 ≤t1 < . . . < tm,
⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨Om(tm) · · · O1(t1)⟩ρβ + O(e−λ2gt1) ,
as t1 →∞,
(3.12)
and the correlation functions exhibit the following ‘exponential cluster property’:
⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ = ⟨O1⟩ρβ⟨O2⟩ρβ + O(e−λ2g|t2−t1|) ,
as t2 −t1 →∞.
(3.13)
(In these equations, O(t) stands for Oχ=0(t).)
In (3.13), we consider only two observables; but an analogous statement holds for n > 2 observables.
As already remarked, Ati is commutative. Hence the positive and normalized functional O 7→⟨O⟩β on Ati
can be expressed in terms of a probability measure. Recall that O ∈Ati is of the form Mf for f ∈C(Td).
Anticipating the notation of Theorem 3.4, we can write
⟨Mf⟩ρβ = ⟨f, ζ0,λ⟩L2(Td) .
Next, we state results that hold oﬀequilibrium: In the theorems below, we use the notation O(t) for Oχ(t),
even if χ ̸= 0.
Our next result describes the approach of the state of the system to a ‘Non-Equilibrium Stationary State’
(NESS), in the limit of large times. However, it is slightly weaker, because we are forced to consider ergodic
averages, since the external force ﬁeld attenuates dissipative eﬀects of the reservoirs; for a more extended discussion
we refer to [3]. In fact, in statement (3.14) of Theorem 3.5, we cannot even control the ergodic average, but only
the abelian average.
Theorem 3.4. [Approach to NESS] There are constants kλ, kχ, such that, for 0 < |λ| < kλ, |χ| < kχ, there
exists a real-analytic function ζ ≡ζχ,λ on Td, satisfying ζ ≥0 and
R
Td dk ζ(k) = 1, i.e., ζ is a probability density,
such that the following statements hold for any exponentially localized density matrix, ρS, and continuous function
f : Td →R:
10

i. For χ ̸= 0,
1
T
Z T
0
dt ⟨Mf(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨f, ζχ,λ⟩L2(Td) + O(1/T ) ,
as T →∞.
ii. For χ = 0,
⟨Mf(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨f, ζ0,λ⟩L2(Td) + O(e−λ2gt) ,
as t →∞,
where g > 0 is the decay constant appearing in (3.12) and (3.13). Moreover ζ0,λ satisﬁes ‘time reversal
invariance’; ζ0,λ(k) = ζ0,λ(−k).
Our next result asserts that the motion of the particle is diﬀusive around an average uniform motion.
Theorem 3.5. [Diﬀusion] Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 3.4,
lim
t→∞
1
t ⟨X(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = v(χ) ,
where v(χ) is the ‘asymptotic velocity’ of the particle and is given by v(χ) = ⟨∇ε, ζχ,λ⟩. For χ ̸= 0, we have
v(χ) ̸= 0. The dynamics of the particle is diﬀusive, in the sense that the limits
Dij(χ) := lim
T →∞

T 2
Z ∞

dt e−t
T ⟨(Xi(t) −vi(χ)t)(Xj(t) −vj(χ)t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β
(3.14)
exist, where the ‘diﬀusion tensor’ D(χ) is positive-deﬁnite, with D(χ) = O(λ−2), as λ →0.
Note that the claim about the asymptotic velocity follows formally from Theorem 3.4 by deﬁning the velocity
operator as
V j := i[H, Xj] = i[T, Xj] = M∇jǫ ,
(3.15)
and writing X(t) = X(0) +
R t
0 dsV (s). Although it is quite easy to make this reasoning precise, we warn the
reader that, at this point, it is formal, because the Heisenberg-picture observables X(t) and V (t) have not been
constructed as operators in the thermodynamic limit. They are formal objects appearing in correlation functions
that are constructed as thermodynamic limits of ﬁnite-volume correlation functions.
Our next result states that the equilibrium diﬀusion matrix D(χ = 0) (which is in fact a multiple of the
identity matrix) is related to the response of the particle’s motion to the ﬁeld χ. The corresponding identity is
known as the ‘Einstein relation’:
Theorem 3.6. [Einstein relation] Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 3.4,
∂
∂χi

χ=0
vj(χ) = λ2βDij(χ = 0) ,
(3.16)
where D(χ = 0) is deﬁned in Equation (3.14) and it equals
Dij(χ = 0) = 1
2
Z
R
dt ⟨V i(t)V j⟩ρβ .
Note that, by the positivity and isotropy of the diﬀusion matrix, this theorem also shows that, for small but
non-zero χ, v(χ) does not vanish. The origin of the unfamiliar factor λ2 on the right side of (3.16) is found in
the fact that the driving force ﬁeld in the Hamiltonian is λ2χ, rather than χ.
4. Dyson expansion: The formalism
In this section and the next one, we expand the eﬀective dynamic ZΛ
[0,t] (see Section 2.5) and correlation functions
in absolutely convergent series. This task is carried out in two steps: First, we derive the expansions without
worrying about careful estimates. To avoid ambiguities concerning the deﬁnition of operators, we do this in
ﬁnite volume. This is done in the present section, which is therefore essentially an algebraic exercise, because the
convergence of the expansions is a trivial matter. In a second step, which is postponed to Section 5, we derive
bounds on these expansions and prove their convergence uniformly in Λ.
In the present section, we set H Λ
S
= ℓ2(Λ), H Λ
Rx = Γs(L2(¯Λ)), etc., as in Section 2.3. To keep notations
simple, we temporarily drop the superscript Λ everywhere. We start by deﬁning ‘Green functions’.
11

4.1. Green functions.The (interacting) Green functions are deﬁned as follows: Recall the equilibrium density
matrix of the reservoirs ρR,β = Z−1
R,βe−βHR, ZR,β = Tr e−βHR, and let ρ be a density matrix on HS. We deﬁne a
map Q : B1(HS) →B1(H ) : ρ 7→ρ ⊗ρR,β. Let I ⊂R+ be a ﬁnite time interval. Subsequently, we abbreviate
inf I and sup I by t−(I) and t+(I), respectively. The length of an interval I is denoted by |I| := t+(I) −t−(I).
Let S1, . . . , Sm be operators acting on B2(HS). The most relevant choice will be Si equal to (Oi)l or (Oi)r for
some ‘observables’ Oi ∈B(HS), i = 1, . . . , m, (we use here the left- and right-multiplications that were deﬁned
in (2.1)). The (interacting) Green function on I is deﬁned as the map

,
(4.1)
where t−(I) ≤s1 < s2 < . . . < sm ≤t+(I), and the trace is over the reservoir Hilbert space HR.
Here,
L := ad(H) = [H, · ] denotes the Liouvillian associated to H, an essentially selfadjoint operator on B2(H ). The
notation Ssj
j , j = 1, . . . , m, merely indicates where the operator Sj should be placed on the right side of (4.1).
In particular, Ssj
j
is not the operator Sj time-evolved to sj. Since the operators carry a time label sj, their
order in the bracket on the left side of (4.1) is irrelevant. We remark that we have deﬁned the Green functions
as operators on B2(HS), i.e., we view density matrices as Hilbert-Schmidt operators through the embedding
B1(HS) ⊂B2(HS) since it is more convenient to work with the Hilbert space B2(HS).
A special case of interest is m = 0, i.e., when no Si’s are present in the Green function. We set
ZI( · ) := GI(∅)( · ) = TrR
h
e−i|I|LQ( · )
i
.
For I = [0, t] this notation agrees with the notation for the eﬀective dynamics in Section 2.5.
For later purposes, we deﬁne a special class of operators on B2(HS): We say S ∈B(B2(HS)) is quasi-diagonal,
whenever its kernel satisﬁes
|S(xl, xr; x′
l, x′
r)| ≤Ce−ν|xl−x′
l|−ν|xr−x′
r| ,
for some ν > 0 ,
(xl, xr, x′
l, x′
r ∈Zd) .
(4.2)
Note the analogy with quasi-diagonal observables O ∈B(HS) deﬁned in Section 3.2; in particular S = (O)ς∈{l,r}
is quasi-diagonal if and only if O is quasi-diagonal.
4.2. An expansion for ZI. In this subsection, we derive an expansion for ZI, with I ⊂R+ a ﬁnite interval.
We deﬁne the free particle dynamics, UI, on B2(HS) by
U[t1,t2] := e−i(t2−t1)ad(HS) ,
t1, t2 ∈R+ ,
HS = T −λ2χ · X ,
(4.3)
and the particle-reservoir interaction, HSR(t), in the interaction picture, which we decompose in spatially localized
terms
HSR(t) := eitHRHSRe−itHR =
X
x
1x ⊗Ψx(t) ,
Ψx(t) := eitHR (a∗
x(φ) + ax(φ)) e−itHR .

eitad(HR)e−itad(H) = U[0,t] −iλ
Z t

ds U[s,t] ad(HSR(s)) eisad(HR) e−isad(H) ,
we ﬁnd the Lie-Schwinger- or Dyson series for ZI:


.
where the n = 0 term on the right side is understood as UI. We refrain from giving a proof of the (norm)-
convergence of this series, since we establish similar, but more involved, bounds in Section 5. We will use the
shorthand notations
1x,ς := (1x)ς ,
Ψx,ς(t) := (−iΨx(t))ς ,
12

for x ∈Λ, ς ∈{l, r} (the left- and right multiplications ( · )ς were introduced in (2.1)). In this notation, the formal
Lie-Schwinger series for ZI can be rewritten as:

(4.5)
In a next step, we evaluate the trace over the reservoir Hilbert space in Equation (4.4) using the quasi-free
property of ρR,β. To do so, we introduce some more notation also applicable to the slightly more complicated
expansions of general Green functions.
4.3. Free Green functions, reservoir correlations and the path expansion of ZI. Let S1, . . . , Sm be op-
erators acting on B2(HS). Let I ⊂R+ be an interval, and choose a set of times t−(I) ≤s1 < s2 . . . < sm ≤t+(I).
We deﬁne free Green functions by
G0
I
 Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m
 := U[sm,t+(I)]Sm . . . U[s1,s2]S1U[t−(I),s1] .
(4.6)
For m = 0, we set G0
I (∅) = UI. As in (4.1), the time labels si just indicate where the operators should be placed.
Since the operators
1x,ς often show up in combination with the free time evolution Ut on B2(HS), we introduce
the following shorthand notation: A path, ̟, over a (closed) interval I ⊂R+ is a ﬁnite collection of triples
(xi, ςi, ti) ,
i = 1, 2, . . . ,
where xi ∈Λ, ςi ∈{l, r} and ti ∈I. The number of triples in a path ̟ is denoted by |̟|. The set of all paths over
an interval I, referred to as ‘path space’, is denoted by PI. The free Green function associated to a path, G0
I (̟),
is deﬁned as
G0
I (̟) := U[tn,t+(I)]
1xn,ςnU[tn−1,tn] · · ·
1x1,ς1U[t−(I),t1] ,
where ̟ = ((x1, ς1, t1), . . . , (xn, ςn, tn)), with t−(I) < t1 < t2 < . . . < tn ≤t+(I), I ⊂R+ an interval.
We can evaluate the term containing the partial trace in (4.4) using the quasi-free property, or Wick rule, of
the reservoir state: If n is odd, this terms vanishes. Hence, we replace n by 2n subsequently. Denote by Pair(n)
be the set of partitions π of the integers 1, . . . , 2n into n pairs. We write (r, s) ∈π if (r, s) is one of these pairs,
with the convention that r < s. Wick’s rule states that
λ2n TrR [Ψx2n,ς2n(t2n) · · · Ψx1,ς1(t1)ρR,β] =
X
π∈Pair(̟)
ζ(̟, π) ,
(4.7)
where ̟ = ((x1, ς1, t1), . . . , (x2n, ς2n, t2n)), Pair(̟) ≡Pair(n), |̟| = 2n, and
ζ(̟, π) :=
Y
(r,s)∈π
λ2h(tr, ts, ςs, ςr)δxr,xs ,

ˆψ(u −v) ,

(4.9)
with ˆψ(t) ≡ˆψΛ(t) as deﬁned in (3.3).

If n = 0, i.e., ̟ = ∅, we set the right side of Equation (4.7) equal to one. Integration over path space PI, I ⊂R+
an interval, is denoted by the shorthand

sections, it is straightforward to derive the path expansion for the interacting Green function GI

for the Green function:

4.5. Polymer expansions.
In this subsection, we rearrange our expansions in a ‘polymer’ form. This will
enable us to explore the exponential decay of the reservoir correlation function ˆψ in the next sections. Given
that paths ̟ are collections of triples, we can deﬁne the ‘union’ path ̟ = ̟1 ∪̟2. Let us write min(t(̟)),
max(t(̟)) for the smallest and largest time in the path ̟, respectively. If max(t(̟1)) < min(t(̟2)), then we
write ̟1 < ̟2.
Given two pairings π1 ∈Pair(̟1), π2 ∈Pair(̟2), with ̟1 < ̟2, we deﬁne π = π1 ∪π2 ∈Pair(̟1 ∪̟2) in
the obvious way, namely (r, s) ∈π if, either (r, s) ∈π1, or (|̟1| + r, |̟1| + s) ∈π2. In an analogous way, we
also deﬁne unions of a ﬁnite ordered set of paths, i.e., ̟1 < ̟2 < . . . < ̟l and pairings over them. Note the
factorization property of the weights ζ deﬁned in Equation (4.8):
ζ(̟1 ∪̟2 ∪. . . ∪̟l, π1 ∪π2 ∪. . . ∪πl) = ζ(̟1, π1)ζ(̟2, π2) . . . ζ(̟l, πl) .
(4.12)
We call a pairing π ∈Pair(̟) irreducible if it can be written as a union π = π1 ∪π2 with πj ∈̟j with
̟ = ̟1 ∪̟2 and ̟1 < ̟2.
We call D := (̟, π), ̟ ∈PI, π ∈Pair(̟), a diagram. A diagram D = (̟, π) is irreducible over an interval
I if π is irreducible and t−(I) = min(t(̟)), t+(I) = max(t(̟)). We deﬁne the domain of a diagram D as
Dom(D) :=
[
(r,s)∈π
[tr, ts] .
Note that a diagram D = (̟, π) is irreducible over I if and only if Dom(D) = I. If a diagram is not irreducible
it can be decomposed uniquely into irreducible diagrams with pairwise disjoint domains:
Dom(D) =
l[
j=1
Dom(Dj) ,
Dj irreducible over Ij ⊆I ,

for some l ≥1, with Dj = (πj, ̟j), such that π = ∪jπj, ̟ = ∪j̟j and ̟1 < ̟2 < . . . < ̟l. It follows that
the diagrams Dj are ordered in the sense that sup Dom(Dj) < inf Dom(Dj+1), j = 1, . . . , l −1 and that Ij are
intervals.

Let I ⊂R+ be an interval. We deﬁne VI ∈B(B2(HS)) as the sum over the ‘amplitudes’ of all irreducible
diagrams over I: Given a path ̟ ∈PI, we use the ‘δ-function’
δ(∂I −∂̟) := δ(min(t(̟)) −t−(I)) δ(max(t(̟)) −t+(I)) ,
(4.14)
to restrict the integration over path space PI to paths having an element (i.e., a triple) at the initial time t−(I)
and an element at the ﬁnal time t+(I) of the interval I. Hence, VI is given by
VI :=
Z
PI
d̟ δ(∂I −∂̟)
X
π∈Pair(̟)
π irreducible
ζ(̟, π) G0
I (̟) ,
(4.15)
where we sum only over irreducible π (alternatively, such π that render the diagram D = (̟, π) irreducible
over I). As in (4.10), the d̟-integral and the ‘δ-function’ in (4.15) are a shorthand notation for certain sums
and integrals; the δ-function in fact indicates that the integral over the time-coordinates is over ∆2n−2
I
instead
of ∆2n
I . Using the factorization property of ζ and the deﬁnition of V we rewrite the path expansion of ZI in
Equation (4.11) in terms of irreducible diagrams:
ZI =
X
l≥0
Z
∆2l
I
dt U[t2l,t+(I)]V[t2l−1,t2l]U[t2l−2,t2l−1] · · · V[t1,t2]U[t−(I),t1] .
(4.16)
This expansion can be viewed as a one-dimensional ‘polymer’ expansion. The polymers correspond to connected
subsets of the interval I with weights given by V. Two polymers ‘interact’ via hard core exclusion taken into
account in the integration domain ∆2l
I . In Equation (4.15), we may consider diagrams with |̟| > 2 as ‘excita-
tions’. Diagrams without ‘excitations’, i.e., diagrams whose irreducible decomposition contains only paths ̟ with
|̟| = 2, are called ladder diagrams. The origin of the nomenclature becomes clear when one only retains diagrams
with |̟| = 2 in the expansion (4.16). In the following sections, we will argue that the leading contributions to
ZI arise from ladder diagrams.
The formalism developed above can also be applied to Green functions: We extend the deﬁnition (4.15) by
setting

B(B2(HS)). Given two times s1, s2 ∈R+ we use the shorthand notation (1), (2), for Ss1

4.6. Generalized expansions.The expansion presented in the previous subsections were appropriate for initial
states of the form ρS ⊗ρR,β. In the present section, we replace the factorized initial states by the coupled ‘Gibbs’
state of the interacting system at vanishing external force χ:
ρβ = 1
Zβ
e−βHχ=0 ,
Zβ = Tr[e−βHχ=0] ,
Hχ=0 = T + HR + λHSR .
To extend our formalism to this particular initial state, we deﬁne operators
D := e−βH/2eβHR/2 ,
D(O) := Ad(D)O = DOD∗,
for observables O in some subspace of B2(H ). Note that D and D are unbounded operators, even in ﬁnite
volume Λ. Their use lies in a non-commutative ‘Radon-Nykodim’ identity:
ρβ = Zβ,R
Zβ
D(1 ⊗ρR) .
Since we are in ﬁnite volume and we do not have periodic boundary conditions, the operators D and D are not
translation-invariant. If they were translation-invariant and O were a translation-invariant observable, then we
could write
Tr [Oρβ] = Zβ,R
Zβ
Tr [OD(1 ⊗ρR)] = Zβ,R|Λ|
Zβ
Tr[OD(1x=0 ⊗ρR,β)] = Tr[OD(ηβ ⊗ρR,β)] ,
(4.20)
with ηβ :=
Zβ,R|Λ|
Zβ
10 and the assumed translation-invariance is used in the second equality.
The rank-one
operator ηβ is positive but not normalized, i.e., TrS[ηβ] ̸= 1, and it has a well-deﬁned thermodynamic limit. Since
translation invariance is broken only at the boundary of Λ, Equality (4.20) is correct up to an error that vanishes
in the thermodynamic limit; (recall the deﬁnition of quasi-diagonal operators in (4.2)).
Lemma 4.1. Assume that the operators S1, . . . , Sm on B2(HS) are quasi-diagonal and translation-invariant in
the sense that
Si(xl, xr, x′
l, x′
r) = Si(xl + y, xr + y, x′

(4.22)
where the error term O(|∂Λ|/|Λ|) is understood as O(L−1), as L →∞. Furthermore, the limit limΛ
Zβ,R|Λ|
Zβ
exists
and is ﬁnite (note that the number Zβ,R|Λ|
Zβ
appears in the operator ηβ in (4.22)).
Note that (4.20) is (4.22) with m = 1, S1 = (O)l and s1 = 0. The proof of Lemma 4.1 is postponed to
Section 5.1.
The representation of equilibrium expectations (and correlations) on the right side of (4.22) is useful for us,
because it allows us to treat equilibrium correlations en par with correlations in a state where the particle is
initially localized on the lattice. Indeed, for, e.g., m = 2, the expression on the right side of (4.22) diﬀers from
the previously considered expressions TrS[GI(Ss2
2 , Ss1
1 )(ρS)] only through the particular choice ρS = ηβ (keeping
in mind that ηβ is not normalized) and the presence of the operator D. Our strategy will be to expand D in its
Lie-Schwinger series (treating again λHSR as a perturbation) and to merge this expansion with the one developed
in the previous sections. Things are set up so that the only change to be made in the framework developed above
is that the interval I is now a subset of Rβ := [−β/2, ∞), and the objects UI and h(s, s′, ς, ς′) need to be redeﬁned
whenever I or {s, s′} have a non-zero intersection with [−β/2, 0). The necessary generalizations are:
i. Free particle propagation UI: For any interval I ⊂Rβ, we set UI := UI2UI1, with I1 ∪I2 = I and
I1 ⊂[−β/2, 0], I2 ⊂R+, and we deﬁne
UI( · ) :=
(
e−i|I|HS( · ) ei|I|HS ,
if
I ⊂R+ ,
e−|I|T( · ) e−|I|T ,
if
I ⊂[−β/2, 0] .
(4.23)
16

ii. Correlation function: It is convenient to introduce the maps m± : Rβ →C deﬁned by m±(s) := s, for
s ≥0, and m±(s) := ±is, for s ∈[−β/2, 0]. Then we set
h(s, s′, ς, ς′) := σ(s, ς)σ(s′, ς′)

if ς = l , ς′ = r ,
(4.24)
where σ(s ≤0, ς) = 1 and σ(s > 0, ς) = −i, i, for ς = l, r, respectively.
With these modiﬁcations, we can extend the deﬁnitions of VI, ZI, GI and all relations between them; in particu-
lar (4.17), (4.18) and (4.19), remain valid. For example, we have from (4.22)

This concludes our discussion on ﬁnite-volume expansions. In the next section, we move on to discussing the
thermodynamic limit and convergence of the series expansions introduced above.
5. Dyson series: Analysis and bounds
In this section, we analyze the Dyson series.
The ﬁrst part, Section 5.1, though lengthy, contains only soft
estimates that require neither the full power of Assumption B, nor the crucial fact that we consider separate
reservoirs at each lattice point. This part could have been avoided by deﬁning the model in the thermodynamic
limit from the start. In contrast, Section 5.2 contains the crucial estimates that are speciﬁc to our model.
5.1. Thermodynamic limit.In the previous section, we have derived the expansion
ZI =
Z
PI
d̟
X
π∈Pair(̟)
ζ(̟, π) G0
I (̟) ,
(5.1)
where I ⊂[−β/2, ∞), with all objects in ﬁnite volume Λ = ΛL. Next, we propose to pass to the thermodynamic
limit. First, we note that the operators ζ(̟, π) G0
I (̟) on the right side of (5.1) are well-deﬁned as operators
on B2(HS), for Λ = Zd, ¯Λ = Rd, respectively. Indeed, the correlation functions ζ are products of the func-
tions ˆψ, which were deﬁned for Λ = Rd in (3.4), and the operators UI are well-deﬁned on B2(ℓ2(Zd)) because
HS = T −λ2χ · X is a self-adjoint operator. Finally, the shorthand
R
d̟ contains sums over xi ∈Λ, which have
to be interpreted now as sums over Zd. This gives meaning to ZI as a series of operators on B2(HS). Likewise,
the series for the correlation functions VI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) and GI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) are well-deﬁned term by term,
respectively, for Sj ∈B(B2(HS)).
Below, we prove convergence of these series and we establish that they are indeed the limits of their natural
ﬁnite-volume counterparts. The main ingredient here is the thermodynamic limit of correlation functions in
Assumption B.
We introduce some notation that will also be used in the subsequent analysis.
Let Λ = ΛL or Zd.
We
write w to denote walks in Λ × Λ, i.e., sequences w = (w0, w1, . . . , wn), where each w is of the form (wl, wr), with
wl, wr ∈Λ, and we write l(w) := n + 1 for the length of the walk. (The walks w should not be confused with the
paths of triples ̟.) On Λ × Λ we use the distance
|w|Λ×Λ = |(wl, wr)|Λ×Λ := |wl| + |wr| ,
17

where | · | denotes the Euclidean distance on Λ. Moreover, we set ∥w∥:= Pn
j=1 |wj −wj−1|Λ×Λ. For simplicity,
we abbreviate |w| ≡|w|Λ×Λ hereafter. Finally, we write w : w →w′ whenever w = w0, w′ = wn, i.e., w is a walk
starting at w and ending at w′.
Subsequently, we use the above notation of walks for kernels of operator acting on B2(HS): Instead of writ-
ing S(wl, wr, w′
l, w′
r), we write S(w, w′), with w = (wl, wr), w′ = (w′
l, w′
r), for S ∈B(B2(HS)). For example,
the deﬁnition of quasi-diagonal operators in (4.2), reads |S(w′, w)| ≤Ce−ν|w′−w|, for some ν > 0, in this notation.
Before we are able to analyze the thermodynamic limit, we still have to deﬁne what is the ‘natural ﬁnite
volume analogue’ of VI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ), GI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) when starting from inﬁnite volume Sj-operators. We set
SΛ
j := Ad(1Λ)SjAd(1Λ) ,
where
1Λ is the orthogonal projection ℓ2(Zd) →ℓ2(Λ).
Lemma 5.1. Let A be one of the following (inﬁnite volume) operators
ZI ,
GI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) ,
VI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) ,
(5.2)
with I ⊂[−β/2, ∞), and S1, . . . , Sm quasi-diagonal. Denote by AΛ their ﬁnite-volume analogues as discussed
above, in particular including the replacement of Sj by SΛ
j . Then, for Λ ﬁnite and for Λ = Zd, the series deﬁning
these operators converge absolutely in norm (as operators on B2(HS)). Moreover,
|AΛ(w, w′)| ≤CIe−c|w′−w| ,
|A(w, w′)| ≤CIe−c|w′−w| ,
where the constant CI can be chosen uniformly in Λ (for |Λ| large enough), including Λ = Zd, independent of the
times s1, . . . , sm and uniform on compacts in t−(I), t+(I). The exponent c > 0 can be chosen to depend only on
the observables S1, . . . , Sm. Finally, for any w, w′,
limΛAΛ(w, w′) = A(w, w′) ,
uniformly on compacts in the variables s1, . . . , sm and t−(I), t+(I).
Proof. The following bounds apply alike in ﬁnite and inﬁnite volume. Denoting by
̟
P
x,ς
the sum over the x- and ς-
coordinates in the path ̟ = ((x1, ς1, t1), . . . , (x2n, ς2n, t2n)), we obtain, for ν > 0 suﬃciently small, and uniformly

used the propagation bound (3.2) and its imaginary time version

for τ ≤β/2. The term between brackets on the last line of (5.3) originates from the sums P

(5.4)
where (2n −1)!! ≡(2n −1)(2n −3) · · · 1 is the number of pairings of 2n elements, i.e., |Pair(n)|, and the
n = 0 term is understood as |UI(w, w′)|. Note that we have used Assumption B to get |ζ(̟, π)| ≤Cn. A
similar estimate holds for GI(·), VI(·), since ultimately we only used that the operators UI satisfy the propagation
estimate |UI(w, w′)| ≤CIe−ν|w−w′|; see (3.2). In the terminology introduced above, this means that UI is quasi-
diagonal. Since the (Sj) are also quasi-diagonal, possibly with a diﬀerent exponential decay rate c > 0, the proof
still applies.
We now turn to convergence of kernels. By the uniform bounds above, the convergence of kernels follows
once we have proved that UΛ
I (w, w′) →UI(w, w′) and ζΛ(̟, π) →ζ(̟, π) for any w, w′, π, ̟, and uniformly
on compacts in the time-arguments. The ﬁrst claim is obvious because HΛ
S →HS strongly, moreover HΛ
S is
bounded for ﬁnite Λ. Thus, functions of HΛ
S converge strongly to functions of HS. The second claim follows from
Assumption B since ζ(̟, π) is a product of the correlation functions ˆψ(t), t ∈Hβ.
We now move towards the proof of Lemma 4.1. We recall that both the particle and the reservoirs are restricted
to ﬁnite volumes Λ and ¯Λ that are related by Λ = ¯Λ ∩Zd. However, since each lattice point is connected to
a separate reservoir, there is no compelling reason for these volumes to be related and this is exploited in the
present proof: We ﬁrst perform the thermodynamic limit for the particle (Λ →Zd) but not for the reservoirs
(¯Λ remains ﬁnite). To that end, we introduce operators e
A on B2(ℓ2(Zd)), with A = ZI, VI, GI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ),
for Sj translation-invariant and quasi-diagonal, and interval I ⊂[−β/2, ∞). These ‘tilde operators’ are obtained
from the ones without tildes by choosing the correlation functions ζ to be ζΛ, i.e., in ﬁnite volume, but choosing
the operators UI and Sj in inﬁnite volume. Therefore, the operators e
A are translation-invariant. Note that given
a collection of translation-invariant and quasi-diagonal operators Sj, we have now three types of objects, namely
AΛ, e
A, A. The latter of the three does not play a rˆole in the proof of Lemma 4.1.
Lemma 5.2. Let AΛ and eA be as described above. Then
AΛ(w, w′) −e
A(w, w′)
 ≤CIe−c′d({wl,wr},Λc)e−c|w−w′| ,
(5.5)
where d(A, B) = infx∈A,y∈B |x −y| for A, B ⊂Λ, and Λc = Zd \ Λ. The constants c, c′ can be chosen uniformly
in I, s1, . . . , sm and S1, . . . , Sm.
Proof. We decompose
HS = HΛ
S + T ∂Λ + HΛc
S ,
(5.6)
where the operator on the left side corresponds to inﬁnite volume, HΛc
S
acts on ℓ2(Λc) and
T ∂Λ(x, x′) =
(
ˆǫ(x′ −x)

conclude that

 ≤CeCte−c|x−x′|e−c′ max(d(x,Λc),d(x′,Λc)),

and hence we also have
|UΛ
I (w, w′) −UI(w, w′)| ≤CIe−c′d({wl,wr},Λc)e−c|w−w′| .
(5.10)
Obviously, we can equally well choose {w′
l, w′
r} instead of {wl, wr} on the right side of (5.10). Furthermore,
we can also replace the diﬀerence UΛ
I −UI on the left side by SΛ −S for quasi-diagonal S, and we can allow
I ⊂[−β/2, ∞).
To address AΛ −˜
A as required, we recall that the correlation functions ζ in both operators are the same (i.e.
the ﬁnite-volume ones) so that the only diﬀerences originate in the diﬀerence on the left side of (5.10) (or the
generalizations just mentioned). By repeatedly applying (5.10) and using the same strategy as in Lemma 5.1 to
sum/integrate over ̟, we get the claim of the Lemma.
Proof of Lemma 4.1. We abbreviate g(Λ) := Zβ,R|Λ|
Zβ
. Recall that
ρβ = g(Λ) 1
|Λ|D(1 ⊗ρR) = g(Λ) 1
|Λ|
X
x∈Λ
D(1x ⊗ρR) .
(5.11)
Therefore, the left side and right side of (4.22) may be written as

AΛ(y, y, 0, 0) .
(5.13)
Since the (Sj) were assumed to be translation-invariant on Λ and quasi-diagonal, they are ﬁnite-volume restrictions
of truly translation-invariant and quasi-diagonal operators. Therefore, Lemma 5.2 applies to the operator AΛ
above and the associated e
A are translation-invariant. Let us split AΛ = e
A + KΛ in (5.13) with KΛ := AΛ −e
A .
By translation invariance, we can drop the terms containing e
A, so (5.13) equals

(5.15)
Recall that we need to prove that the diﬀerence between the two expressions in (5.12) is O(|∂Λ|/|Λ|). This
follows from (5.15) provided that g(Λ) remains bounded as Λ →Zd, as we show now: By an application of the
Golden-Thompson inequality and exploiting the fact that c1 ≤e±βT Λ ≤C
1, for 0 < c < C < ∞, uniformly in Λ,
it suﬃces to check that
0 < c′ ≤Tr e−β(HR+λHSR)
|Λ| TrR e−βHR
≤C′ < ∞,
(5.16)
uniformly in Λ. The operators in the exponent can be explicitly diagonalized (they are polynomials of order 2
in creation and annihilation operators) and (5.16) follows then after a straightforward calculation by the bound
on (3.5). Note for further reference that this also shows that 1/g(Λ) is uniformly bounded as Λ →Zd.
It remains to show that limΛ g(Λ) exists. Since Tr[ρβ] = 1, we have
1
g(Λ) = 1
|Λ|
X
x∈Λ
Tr [D(1x ⊗ρR)] ,
(5.17)
20

and by (5.15), taking now AΛ = ZΛ
[−β/2,0], we get
1
g(Λ) = Tr[ZΛ
[−β/2,0](10)] + O
|∂Λ|
|Λ|

.
(5.18)
By Lemma 5.1, the limit limΛ Tr[ZΛ
[−β/2,0](10)] on the right side exists and is ﬁnite. Hence, either g(Λ) diverges
or limΛ g(Λ) exists and is ﬁnite. But the ﬁrst possibility was excluded above, hence the proof is complete.
To construct the correlation functions (3.10, 3.11) with O ∈X, (X the ∗-algebra generated by the position
operator (Xj)), we want to consider Sj = fj(X)ς, ς = l, r, for some polynomials fj. In this case, one can no longer
expect VI(·) or GI(·) to be a bounded operators; but their kernels are obviously well-deﬁned, and we can still
follow the proof of Lemma 5.1, bounding |Sj(w′, w)| ≤Cδw,w′|w|Nj, where Nj is the degree of the polynomial fj.
We obtain
|AΛ(w, w′)|, |A(w, w′)| ≤C|w|Ne−ν|w−w′| ,
uniformly in Λ, for some N that is determined by the S1, . . . , Sm. This polynomial growth in |w| is compensated
by the exponential decay, so that, for exponentially localized ρS, (see (3.7)), expressions such as GI(·)ρS, GI(·)ρS,
etc. are again exponentially localized operators. For example, the following identity (trivial in ﬁnite volume)
holds for exponentially localized ρS and interval I ⊂R+:

Another useful identity is obtained by applying the relation X(t) −X(0) = R t
0 ds V (s), with V the velocity
operator, in correlation functions, e.g.,
⟨(X(t) −X(0))2⟩ρS⊗ρR,β =

⟨(X(t) −X(0))⟩ρS⊗ρR,β =
Z t
0
ds1⟨V (s1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β ,
(5.21)
for exponentially localized ρS. Here, the left sides should be interpreted as linear combinations of correlations
functions, e.g.,
⟨(X(t) −X(0))2⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨(X(t))2⟩ρS⊗ρR,β −⟨X(t)X(0)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β −⟨X(0)X(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β + ⟨(X(0))2⟩ρS⊗ρR,β .
Proof of Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2. The thermodynamic limit of ZI is immediate from Lemma 5.1, by the convergence
of kernels and the exponential bounds. To deal with correlation functions, we note that, for ﬁnite Λ,
TrS[G[0,t](Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m )ρS] = ⟨Om(sm) . . . O1(s1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β ,
(5.22)
with Sj = (Oj)l, 0 ≤s1 < . . . < sm ≤t. Using the existence of the thermodynamic limit for GI(·) and the
exponential bounds, we show the convergence for exponentially localized ρS and Oj ∈
◦
A (i.e., Oj quasi-diagonal)
or Oj ∈X, thus deﬁning the right side of (5.22) for Λ = Zd. The extension to A is by density. (For m = 2, the
ordering of the times can be relaxed on the right side of (5.22) by setting S1 = (O1)r, which leads to an exchange
of O1(s1) and O2(s2) on the right side.)
For equilibrium correlation functions, we ﬁrst recall that the rank-one operator ηβ is well-deﬁned in the
thermodynamic limit by Lemma 4.1. Then, the argument is analogous to the one above, but replacing (5.22) by
TrS[G[−β/2,t](Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m )ηβ] = ⟨Om(sm) . . . O1(s1)⟩ρβ .
(5.23)
We set χ = 0, i.e., Oj(s) replaced by Oχ=0
j
(s) and we consider (5.23) with m = 2. The time-reversal invariance and
stationarity of (5.23) follow from the ﬁnite volume system, where they are explicit. The only thing left to prove
is the inﬁnite-volume KMS condition: We note that the construction of (5.23) can be carried out when s1 −s2
is in the strip Hβ and the conclusions of Lemmas 4.1 and 5.1 remain valid. This is checked straightforwardly by
using that the operators e−isHS remain quasi-diagonal for s ∈Hβ (in fact, for any s ∈C) and the correlation
functions ζ(̟, π) remain well-deﬁned, because, upon taking 0 ≤Im(s1 −s2) ≤β, all arguments of the function ˆψ
21

in (4.24) remain in the strip Hβ, as one veriﬁes by inspection. Hence, the thermodynamic limit is still valid
for s1 −s2 ∈Hβ in the sense that the correlation functions ⟨OΛ
2 (s2)OΛ
1 (s1)⟩ρΛ
β are bounded uniformly in Λ and
converge uniformly on compact sets in s1 −s2 ∈Hβ. Therefore, the limit of the ﬁnite-volume correlation function
is analytic in the interior of the strip and continuous on the boundary. Thus, the KMS condition in inﬁnite-volume
follows from the one in ﬁnite volume.
5.2. Bounds on the eﬀective dynamics.
Up to now, we have established bounds on the free correlation
functions G0
I , from which we could derive crude bounds on the interacting correlation functions. This is suﬃcient
to prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit. In what follows, we prove sharper bounds on the interacting
correlation functions in inﬁnite volume, using the decay properties of the reservoir correlation function. From
now on, all quantities refer to inﬁnite volume, unless mentioned otherwise.
5.2.1. Bounds on diagrams.In analogy to the operator VI deﬁned in (4.17), we set, for n ∈N,
V(n)

m ) :=

(5.24)
with V(2)
I
= VI, because the smallest irreducible diagrams have |̟| = 2. In Lemma 5.3, we provide a bound on
the right side. To save writing, we introduce
˜h(t) :=
sup
Re(s′−s)=t
s−s′∈Hβ,ς1,ς2∈{l,r}
|h(s, s′, ς1, ς2)| .
(5.25)
From Assumption B, we get
|˜h(t)| ≤Ce−gR|t| .
Lemma 5.3. For suﬃciently small λ, ν > 0, for any n ≥1, any interval I ⊂[−β/2, ∞) and an arbitrary

where the constant C depends only on ˜h, the particle dispersion relation ε, and the spatial dimension d.
Proof. Recalling the deﬁnition of the integration measure d̟ on PI in (4.10), we perform the integration on the
right hand of (5.24), by ﬁrst ﬁxing the number of triples in ̟, (|̟| = 2p, p ≥n), and the time coordinates
in ̟, (t1, . . . , t2p), while summing over the spatial- and ς-coordinates. The times s1, . . . , sm induce a partition
of the time interval I into m + 1 intervals I(j), j = 0, . . . , m, and, almost surely with respect to the ﬁxed times
t1, . . . , t2p, also a partition of the path ̟ ∈PI into subpaths ̟(j) (they can be empty, i.e., ̟(j) = ∅). We denote
by
̟(j)
P
x,ς
the sum over the x- and ς-coordinates of ̟(j). For any one of those I(j), ̟(j), we use (5.3) with ν replaced
by ˜ν, to obtain, for any 0 ≤ν ≤˜ν,

(5.27)
This way, we have bounded the x- and ς-sums in (5.24), so that we are left with the t-integral, π-sum and the
sum over p ≥n. More precisely, to pass from (5.27) to (5.26), it suﬃces to show

is over all x-,ς-coordinates of ̟. Consider any pairing π in the sum on the left hand side; by irreducibility, we
know that P
(r,s)∈π |tr −ts| ≥|I| and that t1 = t−(I), t2p = t+(I), so we can bound the left hand side by

(5.32)
where the p = 0 term on the left hand side of (5.31) is understood to equal 1. The bounds (5.31),(5.32) hold for
n ≥0, n ≥1, respectively.
Proof. For any pairing (r, s) ∈π and the corresponding time coordinates tr, ts we set ui := tr and vi := ts, where
the indices i = 1, . . . , n are chosen such that t−(I) ≤u1 < u2 < . . . < un ≤t+(I). Note that, by our deﬁnition of
a pairing, ui < vi. By using the change of variables t →(u, v), we rewrite the left side of (5.31) as
ZI(n) :=

∆2p

k(vj −uj) ,
(5.33)
with the p = 0 term being 1, and we set ZI(n < 0) := ZI(0). Each vj-integral is bounded by ∥k∥1, the integral
over ∆n
I gives |I|n/n! and (5.31) follows. To derive (5.32), we split the expression according to whether the
23

pairing π contains the pair (1, 2n) or not. In the ﬁrst case, we note that the time-coordinates of all pairs other
than (1, 2n) are not constrained and hence we get the estimate
|k(t+(I) −t−(I))| |ZI(n −1)| ,
(5.34)
where the ﬁrst factor originates from the pair (1, 2n). In the second case, there are pairs (1, j), (j′, 2n) with
j ̸= 2n, j′ ̸= 1. The time coordinates of all other pairs are again unconstrained, so we get the estimate
Z
dv |k(v −t−(I))|
Z
du |k(t+(I) −u)| |ZI(n −2)| ,
(5.35)
where the ﬁrst and second factor originate from the pairs (1, j), (j′, 2n), respectively. Equation (5.32) then follows
from adding (5.34) and (5.35), and using (5.31) to evaluate ZI(·).
To bound (5.29), we ﬁrst choose ˜ν small enough such gR
3 −C˜ν > 0 and hence k as deﬁned in (5.30) belongs
to L1(R+) ∩L∞(R+). Then, by (5.32), we bound (5.29) by
e−2gR

∥k∥∞e|I|∥k∥1
n−1

1e|I|∥k∥1

(5.36)
Finally, we use ex
n ≤xnex/n! for x ≥0, and we choose |λ| small enough compared to (˜ν)−2d, so that ∥k∥1 ≤gR/3
and (5.36) is bounded by the right side of (5.28).
5.2.2. Bounds on correlations functions with unbounded observables.
As argued previously, we cannot bound
the correlation functions GI(·), VI(·) in norm when Sj is unbound, for some j, but we can bound their kernels.
For future use in Section 6, let us bound ∂χV(n)
I
ρS for an exponentially localized ρS and interval I ⊂R+. This
quantity is given by (see (5.19))

(5.38)
where ν is chosen so small that |ρS(w0)| ≤Ce−ν|w0|. Higher derivatives lead to an obvious generalization of (5.38);
the k’th derivative will produce the factor max(1, |I|n+k−1)(Cλ2)n+k on the right side (because the kth derivative
corresponds to k time-integrations over s1, . . . , sk in the generalization of (5.37)) and k factors |wi|, i = 1, . . . , k,
but these can still be controlled by the exponential decay in |w0| and |wi+1 −wi|. An obvious consequence of
(5.38) is that, for exponentially localized ρS, the function
χ 7→V(n)
I
ρS
(5.39)
is C∞and that all derivatives are exponentially localized operators, too.
5.2.3. Bounds on the eﬀective dynamics ZI.Next, we show how the bounds in Lemma 5.3 help to control the
reduced evolution ZI and the correlations functions GI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ). If we demand that S1, . . . , Sm are quasi-
diagonal, then Lemma 5.3 immediately yields

for λ, ν > 0 suﬃciently small, with C′ depending on the Sj’s. To get a bound on the operator norm, we note that
∥S∥≤sup
w
X
w′
|S(w′, w)| ,
where the supremum and the sum are over Zd × Zd.
24

Next, we deﬁne operators Jθ, with θ = (θl, θr) ∈Cd × Cd, by
JθO := e−i(θl,X)O e−i(θr,X) ,
O ∈B(HS) .
(5.41)
Note that Jθ is unbounded if θ has an imaginary part. Also note that an operator O ∈B2(HS), is exponentially
localized iﬀ∥JθO∥2 < ∞, for θ = (θl, θr) in some complex neighborhood of (0, 0).
From (5.40), we get for 0 < λ and θ ∈C2d suﬃciently small, in particular |θ| ≤ν,
∥JθVI(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m )J−θ∥≤C′(C|λ|)2n max(1, |I|n−1)e−gR
3 |I| .
(5.42)
This implies that V(n)
I
(Ss1
1 , . . . , Ssm
m ) preserves the subspace of exponentially localized density operators.
Using the above bounds on V(n)
I
( · ), with m = 0, and propagation bounds on UI, namely
∥Jθ UIJ−θ∥≤Ceλ2|I|O(|θ|) ,
for I ⊂R+ ,
∥Jθ UIJ−θ∥≤C ,
for I ⊂[−β/2, 0] ,
we can bound the series in (4.16) and (4.26) by

5.3. Laplace transform of Green functions. As already mentioned in the introduction, it is more convenient
to conduct our analysis of the long-time behaviour of ZI in the energy-domain, instead of the time-domain. For
suﬃciently large Re z, we set
R(z) :=
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt Z[0,t] ,
Rβ(z) :=
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt Z[−β/2,t] ,
(5.43)
M(z) :=
Z ∞

[0,t]) ,
Rex(z) :=
Z ∞

(5.44)
and (as elucidated below),
Y(z) := Z[−β/2,0] +
Z ∞

dv e−zv
Z 0
−β
du V[u,v]Z[−β/2,u] .
Note that M is the sum/integral of the lowest order diagrams. When writing ∥A∥, where A is an operator acting
on (a subspace of) B2(HS), we understand ∥· ∥to be the standard operator norm on B(B2(HS)).
Recall the deﬁnition of the operators Jθ, with θ ∈C2d, in (5.41).
Lemma 5.5. The operator-valued function (z, θ) 7→JθA(z)J−θ, with A = M, Rex, Y, is analytic in the region
|θ| < kθ, Re z > −kz, for some kz, kθ > 0, and satisﬁes the bounds (as λ →0)

∥JθRex(z)J−θ∥

∥JθY(z)J−θ∥
= O(λ0) .
(5.45)
Moreover, for Re z > 0,
Rβ(z) = R(z)Y(z)
(5.46)
and
R(z) = (z −LS −M(z) −Rex(z))−1 ,
(5.47)
where LS = ad(HS) is the Liouvillian of the particle system.
25

Proof. The bounds on Rex(z), M(z) are (the Laplace transform of) the bound in (5.42) for m = 0 and n = 2,
n = 1, respectively, with kθ < ν, and kz = gR/4. For the bound on Y(z), we also use that ∥ZI∥≤C, for intervals
I ⊂[−β/2, 0], as established above. To get (5.47), let us abbreviate
Rirr.(z) := M(z) + Rex(z) ,
RS(z) := (z −LS)−1 .
Since LS is selfadjoint (as an operator on B2(HS)), we have ∥RS(z)∥≤| Re z|−1.
We choose λ suﬃciently
small and Re z suﬃciently large such that ∥Rirr.(z)RS(z)∥≤| Re z|−1∥Rirr.(z)∥< 1. Starting from the ‘polymer
expansion’ of Z[0,t] in Equation (4.16) and taking the Laplace transform, we ﬁnd that
Z ∞

dt e−zt Z[0,t] =
∞
X
n=0
RS(z)
 Rirr.(z)RS(z))n = RS(z)(1 −Rirr.(z)RS(z))−1 ,
which is (5.47), for Re z large enough. Since ∥ZI∥≤C, the left side of (5.47) is an analytic function in the
region {z ∈C : Re z > 0} and we can extend (5.47) to that region by analytic continuation. Finally, the relation
Rβ(z) = R(z)Y(z) follows (ﬁrst for Re z large enough) by taking the thermodynamic limit and the Laplace
transform of (4.26) (and then by continuing analytically in z).
5.4. Fiber decomposition.We interrupt our analysis of Green functions in order to recall the ﬁber decompos-
ition.
To start with, we note that B1(HS) ⊂B2(HS), HS = ℓ2(Zd). Hence, we may view density matrices on HS
as elements of the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, B2(HS) ≃L2(Td × Td, dkldkr). We deﬁne
bO(kl, kr) :=
1
(2π)d
X
xl,xr∈Zd
O(xl, xr)e−ikl·xl+ikr·xr ,
O ∈B2(ℓ2(Zd)) .
In what follows, we will write O for bO. To conveniently cope with the translation invariance of our model, we
make the following change of variables
k := kl + kr
2
,
p := kl −kr ,
and, for a.a. p ∈Td, we obtain a well-deﬁned function Op ∈L2(Td) by putting
(Op)(k) := O

k + p
2, k −p
2

.
(5.48)
This follows from the fact that the Hilbert space B2(HS) ≃L2(Td × Td, dkldkr) can be represented as a direct
integral
B2(HS) ≃
Z ⊕
Td dp Hp ,
O =
Z ⊕
Td dp Op ,
(5.49)
where each ‘ﬁber space’ Hp can be identiﬁed with L2(Td).
Recall the deﬁnition of the operators Jθ, with θ ∈C2d, in (5.41). The following lemma captures some identities
used later on.
Lemma 5.6. Let O ∈B1(HS), then
TrS[Oeip·X] = ⟨1, Op⟩L2(Td) =
Z
Td dk Op(k) ,
p ∈Td .
(5.50)
If there is a δ > 0 such that ∥Jθ/2O∥2 < ∞, for |θ| ≤δ, then p 7→Op is analytic in the interior of the strip Vδ.
(In the discussion above, the ﬁber operator Op is deﬁned for a.a. p, for O ∈B2(HS), but in the context of
Lemma 5.6, Op can be deﬁned for arbitrary p. The ﬁrst statement of the lemma follows from the singular-value
decomposition for trace-class operators and standard properties of the Fourier transform. The second statement of
Lemma 5.6 is the Paley-Wiener theorem, i.e., the relation between exponential decay of functions and analyticity
of their Fourier transforms; see [7].)
26

The ﬁber decomposition in Equation (5.49) is useful when one deals with operators A acting on B2(HS) that
are translation-invariant (TI), i.e., TzAT−z = A, with Tz deﬁned as in Section 3.2. An important example of a TI
operator A is the reduced time-evolution Z[0,t], see Lemma 3.1. For TI operators A, we ﬁnd that (AO)p depends
on Op only, and hence it makes sense to write
(AO)p = ApOp ,
A =
Z ⊕
Td dp Ap .
(5.51)
Similarly to Lemma 5.6 above, we ﬁnd that, if Jθ/2AJ−θ/2 is bounded for all θ = (θl, θr), with |θ| ≤δ, then
the map p 7→Ap is analytic in a strip Vδ.
5.5. Identifying the lowest order contributions:
LS + M(z).We return to our the analysis of Green
functions.
Identifying the ﬁber spaces Hp with L2(Td), we interpret (LS)p + M(z)p as an operator acting
on L2(Td).
First, we observe that
λ−2(LS)λ2κ = iκ · ∇ǫ −χ · ∇+ O(λ2κ) ,
(5.52)
in the limit κ →0, λ →0.
Second, displaying the χ-dependence in M(z) explicitly, a straightforward calculation yields, (see Section 6.2
in [3]),
λ−2(M(z = 0, χ = 0)λ2κf)(k) = (Gf)(k) + (Lf)(k) ,
f ∈L2(Td) ,
(5.53)
where
(Gf)(k) :=
Z
Td dk′ r(k′, k)f(k′) ,
(Lf)(k) := −
Z
Td dk′ r(k, k′)f(k) ,
(5.54)
with r(·, ·) : Td × Td →C, the ‘rate function’
r(k, k′) = ψ[ǫ(k′) −ǫ(k)] ,
(5.55)
where ψ is the ‘spectral reservoir density’ deﬁned in (3.6). Starting from Assumptions A and B, it is straightfor-
ward to verify that r( · , · ) is a real-analytic function in both variables, which is strictly positive almost everywhere
for real arguments.
Hence, taking into account the contributions in (5.52), we are led to consider the operator
M κ,χ := iκ · ∇ǫ −χ · ∇+ G + L ,
(5.56)
which is densely deﬁned on L2(Td), with core C∞(Td).
The operator M κ,χ has the physical interpretation of a generator of a one-parameter (strongly continuous)
semigroup on L2(Td), often referred to as linear Boltzmann evolution. A detailed analysis of the spectrum of M κ,χ
and of the associated evolution equation has been carried out in [3]. The next lemma captures the main results
of Section 6 of [3].
Lemma 5.7. There exist constants kκ, kχ > 0, such that for |κ| ≤kκ and |χ| ≤kχ the following holds.
i. The spectrum of the operator M κ=0,χ, |χ| ≤kχ, satisﬁes
σ(M κ=0,χ) ⊂{0} ∪{z ∈C : Re z ≤−gM(χ)} ,
(5.57)
for some gM(χ) > 0.
Moreover, 0 is a simple eigenvalue.
The spectral projection associated with the
eigenvalue 0 is of the form |ζχ
M⟩⟨1|, where ζχ
M ∈L2(Td) is a strictly positive, smooth function on Td,
normalized such that ⟨1, ζχ
M⟩L2(Td) = 1.
ii. The spectrum of the operator M κ,χ, |κ| ≤kκ, |χ| ≤kχ, satisﬁes
σ(M κ,χ) ⊂{uM(κ, χ)} ∪{z ∈C : Re z ≤−gM(κ, χ)} ,
(5.58)
where uM(κ, χ) = O(κ) and gM(κ, χ) = gM(χ) + O(κ) > 0. Moreover, uM(κ, χ) is a simple (isolated)
eigenvalue, whose associated spectral projection, P κ,χ
M , can be written as |ζκ,χ
M ⟩⟨eζκ,χ
M |, with ζκ,χ
M , eζκ,χ
M
∈L2(Td)
two smooth functions on Td, normalized such that ⟨eζκ,χ
M , ζκ,χ
M ⟩= 1.
27

In the following we will refer to ζκ,χ
M
as the invariant state of M κ,χ.
We refer to Section 6 of [3], for a detailed proof of this lemma. One key ingredient is that the spectrum of
the multiplication operator L has a gap, as follows from the strict positivity of the rate function r( ·, · ). Since
χ · ∇is anti-self adjoint, the operator −χ · ∇+ L has the same gap. Next, since the rate function is analytic in
both variables, G is a compact operator. Then Weyl’s theorem on the stability of the essential spectrum and a
Perron-Frobenius type argument, using again the positivity of the rate function, yield part i. Part ii follows from
analytic perturbation theory since iκ · (∇ǫ) is a bounded operator.
Next, recalling the deﬁnition of M, we obtain from (5.52) and (5.53), for χ = 0,
(LS + M(z = 0, χ = 0))λ2κ = λ2M κ,χ=0 + O(λ4|κ|) ,
(5.59)
as λ →0, κ →0. For χ ̸= 0, the situations is more subtle: In (5.53), we have set χ = 0. However, as it turns
out, M(z, χ)p is not an analytic perturbation of M(z, χ = 0)p. To overcome this technical diﬃculty, we deﬁne
an operator f
M λ,κ,χ on L2(Td) by
f
M λ,κ,χ := iκ · (∇ǫ) −χ · ∇+ λ−2(M(z = 0, χ))λ2κ ,
(5.60)
with core D = C∞(Td), such that
(LS + M(z = 0, χ))λ2κ = λ2 f
M λ,κ,χ + O(λ4|κ|) ,
(5.61)
as λ →0, κ →0, holds.
In Section 6.2 of [3], we have proven the following lemma, relating the spectrum of f
M ≡f
M λ,κ,χ to the
spectrum of M ≡M κ,χ in a small neighborhood of zero. Recall the deﬁnition of the gap gM(χ) in Lemma 5.7,
and deﬁne Br to be the disk Br := {z ∈C : |z| ≤r}.
Lemma 5.8. There is a constant r > 0, r ∝gM(0), such that, inside the ball Br, the operators M and f
M
have unique simple eigenvalues uM ≡uM(κ, χ) and uf
M ≡uf
M(λ, κ, χ), respectively, with |uf
M −uM | = O(λ2).
Moreover, for z ∈Br,
1
z −f
M
=

z −uf

For a proof we refer to Lemma 6.3 in [3].
This concludes our discussion on the lowest order contributions. In the following section, we explain how the
higher order contribution can be controlled.
6. Analysis of R(z) around z = 0
In this section, we show that the map z 7→R(z), a priori deﬁned for Re z > 0, can be analytically extended
into the region {z ∈C : |z| < λ2r}, for some r > 0 and λ > 0 suﬃciently small. This is accomplished by
applying perturbation theory to the (ﬁbers of the) operators R(z). The guiding idea is that (R(z))λ2κ is a small
perturbation of (z −λ2 f
M λ,κ,χ)−1. The small parameters will be the coupling constant λ, the (rescaled) ﬁber
momentum κ and the ﬁeld χ.
All of these three parameters are assumed to be suﬃciently small throughout, and we do not repeat this at
every step.
In Lemma 7.4 of [3] we have shown that the map z 7→(R(z))λ2κ has a unique simple pole in a neighborhood
of z = 0, whose residue, P ≡P λ,κ,χ is a rank-one operator with the property that, in the ﬁber indexed by κ = 0,
P λ,κ=0,χ = |ζ⟩⟨1| ,
with
∥ζ −ζM∥L2(Td) = O(λ2) ,
(6.1)
where ζM ≡ζκ,χ
M
is the invariant state of the generator M ≡M κ,χ; see Lemma 5.7. In Lemma 6.1, we establish
that P and ζ are regular function of χ.
To start with, we deﬁne an operator acting on L2(Td):
S ≡S(z, χ, λ, κ) := (LS + M(z) + Rex(z))λ2κ ,
(6.2)
28

such that (R(z))λ2κ = (z−S)−1 whenever the left side is well-deﬁned. Note that S is a closed operator on L2(Td):
It is bounded except for the term χ · ∇that comes from LS.
For simplicity, we often abbreviate S(z, λ, κ, χ) by, e.g., S(z), when considering the function z 7→S(z), with
the other variables kept ﬁxed. We use similar shorthand notations for uM ≡uM(κ, χ), P ≡P λ,κ,χ, etc. in this
and the remaining sections.
Recalling (5.60), we write
S(z) = λ2 f
M + (M(z, χ) −M(0, χ))λ2κ + (R(z))λ2κ .
(6.3)
From the deﬁnition of M(z, χ) in (5.44), we infer, using (5.42), that
∥(M(z, χ) −M(0, χ))λ2κ∥≤Cλ2|z| ,
(6.4)
as an operator on L2(Td). Moreover, from Lemma 5.5, ∥(Rex)λ2κ∥≤Cλ4. Thus for z ∈Bλ2r, r > 0, suﬃciently
small, we have
S(z) = λ2 f
M + O(λ4(1 + |κ|) .
(6.5)
Recall the constants kz and kθ from Lemma 5.5.
Lemma 6.1. Let D ⊂L2(Td) be the dense subspace of real-analytic functions on Td.
i. D is a core for S and SD ⊂D. For all z ∈C satisfying Re z ≥−kz and such that (z −S(z))−1 exists
(i.e., as a bounded operator), we have (z −S(z))−1D ⊂D. Moreover, the diﬀerences S(z) −S(z = 0) and
S(κ) −S(κ = 0) are bounded operators, and they are analytic in the variables κ, z in the region Rez > −kz
and |κ| < kθ.
ii. For f ∈D, the function χ 7→S(χ)f is C∞, and all derivatives are bounded in the variables z, λ, κ, χ,
uniformly on compacts. Moreover, all derivatives of χ 7→S(χ)f, f ∈D, are in D.
iii. Fix r > 0 suﬃciently small, e.g., r = gM(0)/4. Then there is a unique z = z∗(λ, κ, χ) in Bλ2r such that
z −S(z) is not invertible, i.e., such that z ∈σ(S(z)). Denoting this unique z∗by uλ,κ,χ, we have that uλ,κ,χ
is an isolated simple eigenvalue of S(uλ,κ,χ), and when considered as pole of the map z →S(z), the residue
at uλ,κ,χ, P λ,κ,χ, is a rank-one operator.
iv. For r > 0 suﬃciently small,
1
z −S(z) =
1
z −uλ,κ,χ P λ,κ,χ + Rλ,κ,χ(z) ,
(6.6)
for z ∈Bλ2r, where z 7→Rλ,κ,χ(z) is bounded analytic in Bλ2r.
v. The pole u ≡uλ,κ,χ and the operators P κ ≡P λ,κ,χ, Rκ(z) ≡Rλ,κ,χ(z) are analytic in κ and γ. The pole u
is a C∞-function in χ, and, for B = P κ, Rκ(z), the function χ 7→B(χ)f is C∞, for any f ∈D.
Proof. Statements i, iii, iv and the statements about analyticity in κ in item iv have been proven in Section 7
of [3]. Here, we only give the proofs of statement ii and of the claim on regularity in χ in v.
Item ii is a consequence of the discussion in Subsection 5.2.2. In particular, the ﬁrst derivative is constructed
by restricting (5.38) to a ﬁber (take n = 2 to get Rex and n = 1 to get M, for LS, the diﬀerentiability is explicit).
Higher derivatives are dealt with analogously; see the remark after (5.38).
To prove the regularity claim in iv, we ﬁrst note that residue and pole of the map z 7→(z −S(z))−1, can be
expressed as contour integrals,
P =
1
2πi
Z
C
dz
1
z −S(z),
uP =
1
2πi
Z
C
dz
z
z −S(z) ,
(6.7)
with the (positively oriented) contour C := {z ∈C : |z| = λ2r/2}. We claim that

1
z −S(z, χ′) −
1
z −S(z, χ)

f =
1
z −S(z, χ′)(S(z, χ′) −S(z, χ))
1
z −S(z, χ)f ,
f ∈D .
(6.8)
29

By statement i, both sides are well deﬁned for z ∈C and the equality is checked by multiplying both sides
with the invertible operator z −S(z, χ′). Since (z −S(z, χ′))−1 is uniformly bounded for all z ∈C, and since
(z −S(z, χ))−1f is in D, it follows from i that the right side of (6.8) converges to 0, as χ′ →χ, for f ∈D (and
by density this holds for all f ∈L2(Td)). Thus, forming the diﬀerence quotient, we obtain
∂
∂χ
1
z −S(z, χ)f =
1
z −S(z, χ)
 ∂
∂χS(z, χ)

1
z −S(z, χ)f ,
f ∈D ,
(6.9)
where we used that S(z, χ)f, f ∈D, is diﬀerentiable in χ, with derivative uniformly bounded for z ∈C; see
item ii. We also claim that the right hand side deﬁnes a function in D. This follows from (z −S(z, χ))−1D ⊂D,
see i, and
∂
∂χSD ⊂D, see ii. Thus the right side of (6.9) is a function in D, which is uniformly bounded on
compacts in the variables λ, κ, χ and uniformly bounded for all z ∈C. Thus the above procedure can be iterated,
and we infer that (z −S(z, χ))−1f, f ∈D, is a C∞-function in the variable χ, whose derivatives are uniformly
bounded on compacts in the variables λ, κ, χ and for all z ∈C.
The identities in (6.7) then immediately lead to the conclusion that u, Pf, R(z)f, for f ∈D, are C∞-functions
of χ. We refer to [6] for a more detailed treatment of asymptotic perturbation theory.
Replacing S(z) by the Boltzmann generator M κ,χ, the same proof also shows that uκ,χ
M , ζκ,χ
M , in Lemma 5.7,
are C∞-functions of χ.
Next, we recall Lemma 5.8, to compare the eigenvalue uλ,κ,χ, the rank-one operator P λ,κ,χ, with the cor-
responding quantities of the operator M κ,χ, from Section (5.5). Combination of Lemma 5.8 with Lemma 6.1
yields:
Lemma 6.2. For κ = 0, the residue at z = 0, P κ=0, can be written as P κ=0 = |ζλ,κ=0,χ⟩⟨1|, with ζ ≡ζλ,κ,χ a
real-analytic function on Td satisfying
∥ζ −ζM∥= O(λ2) ,
where ζM ≡ζκ,χ
M
is the invariant state of M ≡M κ,χ. For κ = 0, ζ is a probability density on Td. The function
u = u(λ, κ, χ) ∈C satisﬁes
u(κ) = u(−¯κ) ,
|u −λ2uM| = O(λ2) .
Moreover, we have that
u(κ = 0) = 0 ,
P κ=0Rκ=0(z) = 0 .
(6.10)
7. The equilibrium regime χ = 0
In this section, we discuss properties of the equilibrium correlation functions. We will often need restrictions of
operators acting on B2(HS) to the ﬁber space indexed by κ = 0. We indicate these restrictions by writing (A)0,
for A ∈B(B2(HS)), below; in particular, (A)0 acts on L2(Td) ≃Hκ=0. Whenever we use such ﬁber restrictions
of operators pointwisely, i.e., for a given ﬁber indexed by κ = 0, this can be justiﬁed by Lemma 5.6 because all
operators are quasi-diagonal on B2(HS), and we will omit these justiﬁcations.
Recall the results of Theorem 3.4: Statement i, for χ ̸= 0, is proven in [3]; statement ii, for χ = 0, has been
proven in [8]. Note that the statement for χ = 0 is stronger. In the notation of Section 5.5, this follows from
the observation that f
M = M, for χ = 0. As argued in [3, 8], the function z 7→(R(z))λ2κ consequently has only
one pole, namely u(λ, κ, χ = 0), in the region Re z > −λ2gM(κ, χ = 0) + O(λ4). Then, the pole u(λ, κ, χ = 0)
determines the long-time properties. By the inverse Laplace transform, one then proves the following theorem.
Theorem 7.1. [Equilibrium asymptotics] Take χ = 0. Then, for 0 < λ and κ suﬃciently small, there is g > 0
such that
(Z[0,t])λ2κ −eu(κ)tP κ = O
 e−gλ2t
,
t →∞,
as operators on L2(Td).
Note that g can be chosen to be given by g = gM(0)/5. Also recall that u(κ = 0) = 0, by Lemma 6.2. For
the proof, we refer to Theorem 4.5 of [8].

7.1. Correlation functions. In this subsection, we discuss properties of the equilibrium correlation functions
and we prove Theorem 3.3. Below we choose Si = (O)ς, ς ∈{l, r}, with O ∈
◦
Ati, i.e., O is quasi-diagonal and
translation-invariant. The extension of our results to Ati, the norm closure of
◦
Ati, follows by density. Recalling
our discussion on Green functions in Section 4.6, we may represent correlation functions as
⟨O2(s2)O1(s1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = Tr

S2G[0,s2](Ss1
1 )ρS

,
⟨O2(s2)O1(s1)⟩ρβ = Tr

S2G[−β/2,s2](Ss1
1 )ηβ

,
(7.1)
for s2 > s1 ≥0, Si = (Oi)l and ρS an exponentially localized density matrix.
We note, however, that the
representation of correlation functions in (7.1) is not unique, since the value of
TrS[G[0,t](Ss1
1 , Ss2
2 )ρS]
and
TrS[G[−β/2,t](Ss1
1 , Ss2
2 )ηβ] ,
(7.2)
with t ≥s2 > s1 ≥0, is independent of t, as long as t ≥s2, and we may equally well write
⟨O2(s2)O1(s1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = Tr

G[0,t](Ss1


G[−β/2,t](Ss1

(7.3)
This freedom is not apparent in our expansions for G[0,t](Ss1
1 , Ss2
2 ) (or G[−β/2,t](Ss1
1 , Ss2
2 )) because these expansions
contain diagrams ‘crossing’ the time s2. This suggests that there is a ‘sum rule’ in our expansions, and this is
the topic of the next Lemma.
Lemma 7.2. Let P 0 = |ζ0⟩⟨1| be the spectral projection as given in Lemma 7.1 (for κ = 0). Then, for all
s ≥s1 ≥0,

(7.6)
The operator P 0 in front of all terms in (7.6) corresponds to the traces in Equation (7.5). Observe that P 0ZI = P 0
for I ⊂[0, ∞), since ZI is trace preserving. Using this in the two terms of the right side of (7.6) yields (7.4) for
u = 0. The proof for u = −β/2 is similar.
We are now prepared to prove Theorem 3.3. Since the technical input –the exponential decay in Theorem 7.1–
has been prepared, all that remains are some straightforward algebraic manipulations.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. The case m = 1: By Theorem 7.1, we know that, for f a continuous function on Td,
(hence Mf ∈Ati),
TrS[MfZ[0,t]ρS] = ⟨f, ζ0⟩+ O(e−gλ2t) ,
so the only thing in need of a proof is that ⟨f, ζ0⟩= ⟨Mf⟩ρβ. Recall that, by the construction of the equilibrium
dynamics, we have the stationarity property ⟨Oχ=0(t)⟩ρβ = ⟨O⟩ρβ, O ∈
◦
Ati, i.e., (Z[−β/2,t]ηβ)0 = (Z[−β/2,0]ηβ)0,

= ⟨f, P 0 (Y(z)ηβ)0⟩+ z⟨f, R0(z) (Y(z) ηβ)0⟩.
(7.7)
31

The second term on the right side of the second line vanishes at z = 0 by the analyticity of R(z), Y(z). Choosing
f ≡1, we obtain
1 = ⟨1⟩ρβ = ⟨1, P 0 (Y(z = 0)ηβ)0⟩= ⟨1, (Y(z = 0)ηβ)0⟩,
(7.8)
and hence, setting z = 0 in (7.7), ⟨Mf⟩ρβ = ⟨1, ζ0⟩, in particular, (Z[−β/2,t]ηβ)0 = (Z[−β/2,0]ηβ)0 = ζ0.
The case m = 2: First, we prove (3.12). We start by considering the correlation functions TrS

and TrS

S2 G[−β/2,s2](Ss1

. Because we take the trace, and S1, S2 are translation-invariant (hence ﬁber pre-
serving), it is suﬃcient to consider (G[ · ,s2](1))0 with (1) standing for (Ss1
1 ). We obtain that
G[0,s2](1) = Z[s1,s2]S1Z[0,s1] +

(7.11)
If we replace G[0,s2](1) by G[−β/2,s2](1), we get a similar identity, except that P 0 is replaced by P 0Y(z = 0).
However, once (7.11) is applied to (ηβ)0, we can use (7.8), to conclude

This proves (3.12) for m = 2.
In order to prove the ‘cluster property’ of the correlation function, i.e., (3.13), we consider the limit s2−s1 →∞

where we used the stationarity to get the second line. This proves the desired cluster property for m = 2.
The cases m > 2: Straightforward generalization of the above arguments.
8. Proof of Theorem 3.6
We proceed to proving the Einstein relation. Recall the deﬁnition of the velocity operator
V j := i[H, Xj] = i[T, Xj] .
(8.1)
In a ﬁnite volume Λ, the derivative with respect to χ of ⟨V Λ(t)⟩ρΛ
β can be computed using Duhamel’s principle:

ds ⟨[XΛ,i(t −s), V Λ,j(t)]⟩ρβ .
(8.2)
32

Here, it is well-understood that time-evolution on the right side is at χ = 0, whereas on the left side the force
ﬁeld is set to 0 only after the diﬀerentiation. For simplicity, we drop the spatial indices i, j in the following.
Using the time-translation invariance of the state ρΛ
β, the KMS condition (2.13) and the time-reversal invari-
ance of the model at vanishing χ, one ﬁnds that

Again, it is understood that time-evolution on the right side of (8.3) is taken for a vanishing external ﬁeld. For
a detailed derivation of Equation (8.3), we refer to Section 4.2 in [3]. Note that the correlation functions on the
right side involve imaginary times. Finally, we observe that, by the discussion following Lemma 5.1, (8.3) holds
in inﬁnite volume as well.
To complete the proof of Theorem 3.6, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, Q(t) →0, as t →∞.
We ﬁrst establish a lemma concerning the behaviour of correlation functions continued to imaginary times.
Lemma 8.1. The equilibrium correlation functions satisfy the bound
|⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ| ≤C∥O2∥∥O1∥e−λ2g| Re(t2−t1)| ,

for t1 −t2 ∈Hβ and O1, O2 ∈Ati.

Since ∥OΛ∥≤∥O∥, we conclude that the correlation functions in inﬁnite volume satisfy (8.5), too. We set t2 = 0
and deﬁne
fa(t) := eλ2gt−at2⟨O2(0)O1(t)⟩ρβ ,
t ∈Hβ ,
with the decay rate λ2g > 0 as in Theorem 7.1, and a > 0. From Theorem 7.1 and the KMS condition we infer
that
sup
a>0
sup
t∈∂Hβ
|fa(t)| < ∞.
Furthermore, by the inﬁnite-volume version of (8.5), fa is bounded on the whole strip Hβ, and the KMS condition
implies that it is continuous on Hβ and analytic in the interior. Therefore, the maximum principle for inﬁnite
domains (the Phragmen-Lindel¨of theorem) yields
sup
a>0
sup
t∈Hβ
|fa(t)| ≤sup
a>0
sup
t∈∂Hβ
|fa(t)| < ∞.
By varying a, we deduce that |⟨O2(0)O1(t)⟩ρβ| ≤Ce−λ2g| Re t|. By time-translation invariance, the claim of the
lemma follows.
Proof of Theorem 3.6. Recall the deﬁnition of the operator S in (6.2).
Starting from the bounds in Subsec-
tion 5.2.2, Lemma 6.1 says that χ 7→S(z, χ)f is C∞, for f ∈D, (D the set of real-analytic functions on Td). As
pointed out in Lemma 6.1, this implies that the function
(R(z))λ2κf =
1
z −S(z, λ, κ, χ)f ,
f ∈D ,
is also C∞in χ. Inspecting the reasoning in Subsection 5.2.2 leading to (5.39) and restricting to ﬁbers, it is clear
that χ 7→(Y(z))λ2κf, for (z, χ) in a neighborhood of (0, 0), is C∞, with all derivatives uniformly bounded on
compacts. Hence, by (5.46), we get smoothness of χ 7→(Rβ(z))λ2κf. Therefore, for exponentially localized ρS
(in particular ηβ), the function
(z, χ) 7→z⟨∇ε, (Rβ(z)ρS)0⟩,
33

is analytic in z and C∞in χ for (z, χ) in a neighborhood of (0, 0), with the corresponding derivatives uniformly
bounded on compacts.
Next, starting from the identity v(χ) = ⟨∇ǫ, ζ0⟩= limz→0 z⟨∇ǫ, (Rβ(z))0(ηβ)0⟩, we obtain, using the above
regularity properties, that
∂

χ=0
v(χ) = lim
z→0 z ∂
∂χ

χ=0
⟨∇ǫ, (Rβ(z))0(ηβ)0⟩.
Hence, setting z = 1/T , using the deﬁnition of Rβ and the bounds |⟨V χ(t)⟩ρβ| ≤C and |∂χ⟨V χ(t)⟩ρβ| ≤λ2Ct,
for χ suﬃciently small, as follows from (5.19), we get

The second equality is (8.3) (in the thermodynamic limit), and the third equality follows because, by Lemma 8.1,
Q(t) →0, as t →∞, and ⟨V V (s)⟩ρβ = O(e−λ2gs), by Theorem 3.3.
To complete the derivation of the Einstein relation we have to argue that the equilibrium auto-correlation
function
R
R ds ⟨V V (s)⟩ρβ is indeed equal to the diﬀusion constant D. This is checked by using the exponential
decay of the correlation function and the identity
