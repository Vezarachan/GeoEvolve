Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum particle hopping on a simple cubic lattice and driven by a constant external force.
It is coupled to an array of identical, independent thermal reservoirs consisting of free, massless Bose ﬁelds, one at each site of the
lattice. When the particle visits a site x of the lattice it can emit or absorb ﬁeld quanta of the reservoir at x. Under the assumption
that the coupling between the particle and the reservoirs and the driving force are suﬃciently small, we establish the following results:
The ergodic average over time of the state of the particle approaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) describing a non-zero
mean drift of the particle. Its motion around the mean drift is diﬀusive, and the diﬀusion constant and the drift velocity are related
to one another by the Einstein relation.
KEY WORDS: diﬀusion, kinetic limit, quantum brownian motion
1. Introduction
In this paper and its companion [6], we study the quantum dynamics of a tracer particle driven by a constant
external force ﬁeld, F, (e.g., a uniform gravitational ﬁeld) and interacting with thermal reservoirs by emitting or
absorbing gapless reservoir modes. The purpose of our analysis is to establish properties of the long-time eﬀective
dynamics of the particle and to justify some ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations, notably the Einstein relations.
Among properties of the eﬀective dynamics of the tracer particle coupled to thermal reservoirs at positive
temperature, we expect the following ones to hold: A velocity-dependent friction force caused by scattering
processes between the particle and the reservoir modes (emission of Cherenkov radiation) can be expected to
counteract the external force driving the particle, in such a way that its mean velocity approaches a ﬁnite, non-
zero limit, v(F), in the direction of the external force F, as time t tends to inﬁnity. Because of thermal ﬂuctuations
in the reservoir(s), the true motion of the particle is expected to be diﬀusive around its mean motion. One might
guess that the mobility,
∂
∂F

F =0v(F), of the particle satisﬁes the ‘Einstein relation’
∂
∂F

F =0v(F) = βD(F = 0) ,
(1.1)
where β is the inverse temperature of the gas and D(F) ≡D(β, F) its diﬀusion constant. This would be the
case if we modeled the dynamics of the particle by a Langevin equation. However, for a particle moving in
physical space R3 and interacting with a single thermal reservoir ﬁlled with a massless, free Bose ﬁeld (e.g., a
1

weakly interacting Bose gas), this guess is almost certainly false! The reason is that, usually, the friction force
caused by interactions of the particle with reservoir modes decreases, as the velocity of the particle grows. One
therefore expects that a suﬃciently large force F will eventually overcome the friction force and cause a ‘run-
away’ acceleration. At positive temperature, thermal ﬂuctuations will, in the long run, always manage to kick
the particle velocity into a region where ‘run-away’ occurs. In fact, some part of the intuition described here has
recently been made precise in a (classical) Hamiltonian model describing the system in a limiting regime where
the particle is very massive and the Bose gas in the reservoir is very dense (mean-ﬁeld limit); see [12, 9]. In these
papers, which only concern systems at zero-temperature, it is shown that the friction force, Ffric(v), tends to 0,
as |v| →∞, and (assuming rotational invariance) |Ffric(v)| = |Ffric(|v|)| has a unique maximum, Fmax, at some
ﬁnite value of |v|. These properties imply that, for |F| < Fmax, there are two stationary solutions of the equations
of motion corresponding to two diﬀerent values,
v−, v+ ,
with
v+ > v−,
of the speed of the particle. Particle motion with speed v+ is likely to be unstable: One expects to ﬁnd ‘run-away’
solutions accelerating to ever higher speed, for initial conditions close to the stationary solution corresponding
to v+.
Thus, at positive temperatures, and for a particle moving in R3 interacting with a single thermal reservoir,
we do not expect to ever observe an approach of the particle’s motion towards a uniform mean motion at a
ﬁnite constant velocity determined by the external force F, as time t tends to inﬁnity, (with diﬀusive ﬂuctuations
around the mean motion). This type of motion – if observed – is a transient phenomenon that may be encountered
at intermediate times, but will disappear at very large times. If the reasoning sketched here is correct the status
of the Einstein relation (1.1) becomes rather questionable.
It actually seems to us that the eﬀective dynamics of a tracer particle in the continuum driven by a constant
external force and interacting with an inﬁnitely extended thermal reservoir (corresponding, e.g., to an ideal or
weakly interacting Bose gas at positive temperature), as described above, is too complicated to be treated with
mathematical precision, at present. We therefore propose to study an idealized model for which the expected phe-
nomenology is much simpler: We imagine that the tracer particle moves through a static crystalline background
of ions modeled by a periodic potential. We assume that the lowest energy band in the given periodic potential
is well separated from the higher lying bands. Assuming that the initial state of the particle is a superposition of
states with energies belonging to the lowest band and following the particle’s motion only over a long, but ﬁnite
interval of time, we may neglect transitions of the particle to states in higher-lying energy bands altogether and
use a tight-binding approximation to describe the dynamics of the particle. This amounts to replacing physical
space R3 by a lattice, e.g., the simple cubic lattice Z3, and to considering a quantum particle hopping on Z3. The
particle is subject to a linear external potential, −F · x, x ∈Z3, and interacts with a dispersive thermal reservoir
at positive temperature. The crucial diﬀerence, compared to the continuum model described above, is that the
speed of a quantum particle hopping on a lattice is uniformly bounded, and there are no ‘run-away solutions’ to
the equations of motion.
Yet, the problem of analyzing the long-time motion of the particle in such a model is still rather challenging,
and although a lot of attention was devoted to problems of this type, see e.g. [3, 23, 22], we do not have any
precise mathematical results, yet. The origin of the diﬃculties lies in memory eﬀects within the reservoir: The
probability for the tracer particle to re-absorb a reservoir mode it has emitted at another position in space, some
time ∆t ago, does not decay to 0 suﬃciently rapidly, as ∆t tends to inﬁnity, to control the eﬀective dynamics. The
reason is that reservoir auto-correlation functions do not decay in time very fast, uniformly in space. (Assuming
they decay in time integrably fast, uniformly in space, one may hope to face a problem that can be solved
rigorously. However, a solution would still require a major eﬀort; see [5, 21] for corresponding results when the
external force F vanishes.) We therefore propose to simplify the problem yet a little further: We assume that,
at each site, x, of the lattice Z3, there is another thermal reservoir, Rx, and that reservoirs at diﬀerent sites of
the lattice are independent. Moreover, all these reservoirs are isomorphic to one another and are described by
free quantum ﬁelds at some positive temperature β−1. When the particle visits the site x it only interacts with
the reservoir Rx. Thus, for memory eﬀects to occur, the particle has to return to a site it has visited previously.
Such memory eﬀects tend to decay exponentially fast in ∆t. Models of this sort, but for a vanishing external
force ﬁeld F, have been introduced and studied in [20]. They are suﬃciently simple to be analyzed rigorously. A
somewhat similar model was treated in [2].
Assuming that, at this point, the reader has an idea of what the models are that will be analyzed in this
paper (see Section 2 for precise deﬁnitions), we proceed to summarizing our main results; (for detailed, precise
2

statements see Section 3, Theorems 3.2 through 3.4). We assume that the strength of interaction between the
particle and the reservoirs is proportional to a coupling constant λ that will be chosen appropriately and that
the external force ﬁeld is given by F = λ2χ, where χ ∈R3 is a ﬁxed vector. The initial state of the system
is given by a product state, ρS ⊗ρR,β, where ρS is a density matrix on the Hilbert space, HS = l2(Z3), of the
tracer particle localized around some site of the lattice, while ρR,β is the equilibrium state of the reservoirs at
inverse temperature β. The time evolution of the initial state in the Schr¨odinger picture is (formally) given by
e−itHρS⊗ρR,β eitH, where H is the Hamiltonian of the system; see Subsections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4. The precise deﬁnition
of the Hamiltonian H involves the dispersion law, ǫ, of the particle and a form factor, φ, that appears in the
interaction Hamiltonian coupling the particle to the reservoirs. In Subsection 3.1, two assumptions, on ǫ and φ,
are formulated that are suﬃcient for the results summarized below to hold and that shall not be described here.
We deﬁne the eﬀective dynamics, Z[0,t], of the particle by
ρS,t ≡Z[0,t]ρS := TrR

e−itH(ρS ⊗ρR,β) eitH
,
(1.2)
where TrR[ · ] denotes the partial trace over the reservoir degrees of freedom. In the thermodynamic limit, the
state ρR,β can no longer be represented by a density matrix and the above formula needs to be re-interpreted,
but the left-hand side remains meaningful.
All the results summarized below are only known to hold, provided the coupling constant λ is suﬃciently
small.
Momentum space of the tracer particle is given by the torus T3. Let f be an arbitrary continuous function
on momentum space. Our ﬁrst result says that

f( · )ρS,t

= ⟨f, ζχ,λ⟩L2(T3) ,
where ζχ,λ is a probability density on T3 describing a stationary state of the tracer particle corresponding to
uniform motion at constant velocity v ̸= 0.
Here, TrS[ · ] denotes the trace over the tracer particle Hilbert
space HS. The interpretation of this result is that the ergodic average over time of the states of the particle
approaches a so-called ‘non-equilibrium steady state’ (NESS). If χ = 0 then ζχ,λ is actually an equilibrium
measure on T3 approximately equal to Maxwell’s velocity distribution, ∝e−βǫ, corresponding to the dispersion
law ǫ.
Our second result says that, asymptotically, the average motion of the tracer particle is uniform, with asymp-
totic velocity

(1.3)
given by v(χ) = ⟨∇ǫ, ζχ,λ⟩. Assuming time-reversal invariance, one sees that v(χ = 0) = 0, and one expects that
limχ→∞v(χ) = 0. To understand the latter, recall that the Hamiltonian of a particle hopping on Z3 and driven
by a constant ﬁeld F, has discrete spectrum, corresponding to Bloch oscillations. The eigenvectors form the
so-called Wannier-Stark ladder, they are localized and their localization length decreases as |F| →∞. Viewed
from this angle, it is quite remarkable that one gets transport upon coupling to the reservoirs.
The third result concerns the fact that the ‘true’ motion of the particle is diﬀusive.
Because of thermal
ﬂuctuations in the reservoirs, the particle performs quantum Brownian motion around its uniform mean motion,
with a diﬀusion tensor given by

Next, we sketch some of the main steps that go into the proofs of these results. The key idea is to show
that the eﬀective dynamics, Z[0,t], of the tracer particle deﬁned in (1.2) is well approximated by its kinetic limit.
Rescaling space and time as (x, t) = λ−2(ξ, τ), the kinetic limit is approached when λ →0, with (ξ, τ) (arbitrary,
3

but) ﬁxed. Let us consider the Wigner distribution, ν(ξ, k), with (ξ, k) ∈R3 × T3, corresponding to the state ρS
of the particle at time t = 0. Then, in the kinetic limit, time evolution is given by a linear Boltzmann equation

∂τ ντ(ξ, k) = (∇ε)(k) · ∇ξντ(ξ, k) −χ · ∇kντ(ξ, k) +

Td dk′
r(k′, k)ντ(ξ, k′) −r(k, k′)ντ(ξ, k)

,
(1.5)
where r(k, k′)dk′ is the rate for a jump of the particle from momentum k to momentum k′. The kernel r(k, k′)
can be expressed in terms of the reservoir auto-correlation function (see Subsections 3.1 and 4.2) and satisﬁes
‘detailed balance’. The second, but last term on the right-hand side of Equation (1.5) is a ‘gain term’, the last
term is a ‘loss term’.
It is convenient to consider the Fourier transform in the variable ξ of Equation (1.5). We set
ˆνκ
τ (k) :=
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd dξ e−i(κ, ξ) ντ(ξ, k) ,
where the ‘pseudo-momentum’ κ ∈Rd is the variable dual to ξ ∈Rd. Then ˆνκ
τ satisﬁes the equation
∂
∂τ ˆνκ
τ = M κ,χˆνκ

where the operator M κ,χ is given by
(M κ,χg)(k) := iκ · (∇ε)(k)g(k) −χ · ∇kg(k) +
Z
Td dk′r(k′, k)g(k′) −
Z
Td dk′r(k, k′)g(k) ,
(1.6)
for g ∈L2(T3). To understand our approach it is important to know that, for any force ﬁeld χ and arbitrary
τ ≥0,
(Z[0,λ−2τ])λ2κ

λ→0

(1.7)
strongly on L2(Td); see Theorem 4.2, Equation (4.9).
The properties of the dynamics generated by the op-
erator M κ,χ are studied in detail in Section 5. It satisﬁes all the results summarized above; (approach to a
NESS describing uniform motion at a ﬁnite velocity, diﬀusion around the average motion, Einstein relation, and
vanishing of v(χ), as χ →∞).
Our goal is then to show that the true dynamics of the tracer particle, as described by the eﬀective time
evolution Z[0,λ−2τ], on the ﬁber corresponding to pseudo-momentum λ2κ and with small, but non-zero λ, is well
approximated by the dynamics in the kinetic limit, as given by the propagator eτMκ,χ. Indeed, we will analyze the
properties of Z[0,t] on the ﬁber corresponding to pseudo-momentum λ2κ, for arbitrarily large times t, by viewing
it as a perturbation of the propagator eλ2tMκ,χ. It will turn out to be convenient to develop the perturbation
theory for the Laplace transforms of Z[0,t] and eλ2tMκ,χ. The Laplace transform of the latter is the resolvent
of the operator λ2M κ,χ, while the Laplace transform of Z[0,t] on the ﬁber with pseudo-momentum λ2κ is a
‘pseudo-resolvent’ that, in a suitable domain of the spectral parameter, can be viewed as a small perturbation of
the resolvent of λ2M κ,χ. This analysis is carried out in Section 7. The formalism in Section 7 relies on material
gathered in [6] (standard Dyson expansion for Z[0,t] and for time-dependent correlation functions). The relevant
results of [6] are summarized in Section 6 of the present paper. In Section 8.1, the system without external force,
i.e., for χ = 0, is analyzed in some detail, and, in Section 8.2, the proofs of the main results are completed.
Finally, let us also point out an interesting eﬀect that we observe in our model and that forces us to state
our results in the sense of ergodic averages (note indeed that a more natural expression in
(1.4) would be
Dij(χ) = limt→∞1
t TrS

(Xi −vi(χ)t)(Xj −vj(χ)t)ρS,t

.) Consider matrix elements ρS,t(x, x′) of the reduced
density matrix. If |x −x′| is large compared to |F|−1, then the free Liouville equation (neglecting the reservoir)
is dominated by the driving ﬁeld and one can neglect the kinetic term, i.e., ρS,t(x, x′) ≈e−iF ·(x−x′)tρS,0(x, x′). In
that case, the dissipative eﬀect of the reservoir vanishes. Indeed, recall that in many-body theory dissipation is
related to the imaginary part of the self-energy, which emerges from virtual transitions. However, if we keep only
the ﬁeld term in HS (as we just argued), then there are no such transitions because the coupling to the reservoirs
is diagonal in the position basis. The conclusion is that these matrix elements ρS,t(x, x′) do not decay with
time, as one would naturally expect. In other words, decoherence is switched oﬀby the ﬁeld! The mathematical
expression of this phenomenon is visible in Lemma 6.2, where we bound the operator f
M λ,κ,χ, which describes
the lowest order (second order) eﬀect of the particle-reservoir coupling. The point to note is that this operator is
4

not close to the operator M κ,χ, which describes the dynamics in lowest order in λ. The diﬀerence between these
two operators comes from the fact that λ also appears in the force ﬁeld, since we set F = λ2χ and keep χ constant.

2. Definition of the model
In this section, we deﬁne our model in a ﬁnite volume approximation.
2.1. Notations and conventions.
2.1.1. Banach spaces. Given a Hilbert space E , we use the standard notation
Bp(E ) :=
n
A ∈B(E ) : Tr
h
(A∗A)p/2i
< ∞
o
,
1 ≤p ≤∞,
with B∞(E ) ≡B(E ) the bounded operators on E , and
∥A∥p :=

Tr
h
(A∗A)p/2i1/p
,
∥A∥:= ∥A∥∞.
For operators acting on Bp(E ), e.g., elements of B(Bp(E )), we often use the calligraphic font: V, W etc.. An
operator A ∈B(E ) determines bounded operators Ad(A) , ad(A) , Al , Ar on Bp(E ) by
Ad(A)B := ABA∗,
ad(A)B := [A, B] = AB −BA
and
AlB := AB ,
ArB := BA∗,
B ∈Bp(E ) .
(2.1)
Note that (A1)l(A2)r = (A2)r(A1)l, as operators on Bp(E ), A1, A2 ∈B(E ), i.e., the left- and right multiplications
commute. The norm of operators in B(Bp(E )) is deﬁned by
∥W∥:=
sup
A∈Bp(E )
∥W(A)∥p
∥A∥p
.
In the following, we usually set p = 1 or 2.
2.1.2. Scalar products. For vectors κ ∈Cd, we let Re κ denote the vector (Re κ1, . . . , Re κd), where Re denotes
the real part. Similar notation is used for the imaginary part, Im. The scalar product on Cd is written as (κ1, κ2)
or κ1 · κ2 and the norm as |κ| :=
p
(κ, κ). The scalar product on an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space E is
written as ⟨· , ·⟩, or, occasionally, as ⟨· , ·⟩E . All scalar products are deﬁned to be linear in the second argument
and anti-linear in the ﬁrst one.
2.1.3. Kernels. For E = ℓ2(Zd), we can represent A ∈B2(E ) by its kernel A(x, y), i.e., (Af)(x) = P
y A(x, y)f(y),
f ∈E . Similarly, an operator, A, acting on B2(E ) can be represented by its kernel A(x, y, x′, y′) satisfying
(Aρ)(x, y) = P
x′,y′ A(x, y, x′, y′)ρ(x′, y′), ρ ∈B2(E ). Occasionally, we use the notation |x⟩for δx ∈E , deﬁned
by δx(x′) = δx,x′, and ⟨x| for ⟨δx , · ⟩. In this notation |x⟩⟨y| stands for the rank-one operator δx ⟨δy , · ⟩. Similarly,
for the choice E = L2(Td), we often use the notation |f⟩for f ∈L2(Td) and ⟨g| for ⟨g, · ⟩, g ∈L2(Td). In this
‘Dirac notation’, |f⟩⟨g| stands for the rank-one operator f⟨g, · ⟩on L2(Td).
2.2. The particle.Consider the hypercube Λ = ΛL = Zd ∩[−L/2, L/2]d, for some L ∈2N. The particle Hilbert
space is chosen as HS = ℓ2(Λ) where the subscript S refers to ‘system’.
5

To describe the hopping term (kinetic energy), we choose a real function ε : Td →R and we consider the
self-adjoint operator T ≡T Λ on ℓ2(Λ) with symmetric kernel1
T (x, x′) = ˆε(x −x′) ,
with ˆε the Fourier transform of ε. Since we will assume ε to be analytic, the hopping is short range.
A natural choice for the dispersion law is ε(k) = P
j 2(1 −cos kj), corresponding to T = −∆, with ∆the
lattice Laplacian on ℓ2(Λ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This choice satisﬁes all our assumptions, to be
stated in Section 3.1.
We deﬁne the particle Hamiltonian as
HS := T −F · X ,
where F ∈Rd is an external force ﬁeld, e.g., an electric ﬁeld, and X ≡XΛ denotes the position operator on HS,
deﬁned by Xf(x) = xf(x). In what follows we will write F = λ2χ, with χ a rescaled ﬁeld, (a notation to be
motivated later).
2.3. The reservoir.
2.3.1. Dynamics. For each x ∈Zd, we deﬁne a reservoir Hilbert space at site x by
HRx := Γs(L2(¯Λ)) ,
where ¯Λ = ¯ΛL = Rd ∩[−L/2, L/2]d and Γs(E) is the symmetric (bosonic) Fock space over the Hilbert space E.
We assume that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of second quantization, such as Fock space and
creation/annihilation operators; (we refer to, e.g., [7] for deﬁnitions and background). The total reservoir Hilbert
space is deﬁned by
HR :=
O
x∈Λ
HRx .
Note that for all x, the spaces HRx are isomorphic to each other. We remark that there is no compelling reason
to restrict the one-site reservoirs to the same region, [−L/2, L/2]d, as the particle system, but this simpliﬁes our
notation. The reservoir Hamiltonian is deﬁned as
HR :=
X
x∈Λ
X
q∈¯Λ∗
ω(q)a∗
x,qax,q ,
(2.3)
where ¯Λ∗= 2π
L Zd is the set of quasi-momenta for the reservoir at site x, and the operators a#
x,q are the canonical
creation/annihilation operators satisfying the commutation relations
[ax,q, a∗
x′,q′] = δx,x′δq,q′ ,
[ax,q, ax′,q′] = [a∗
x,q, a∗
x′,q′] = 0 ,
and we choose the dispersion law ω(q) = |q| + δq,0.
Note that this dispersion law corresponds to photons
or phonons, except for q = 0, where we have modiﬁed this dispersion law at q = 0 by adding an infrared
regularization that does not aﬀect any of our results; e.g., if we replace δ0,q by Kδ0,q, with K > 0, then all
inﬁnite-volume objects studied in this paper are independent of K.
2.3.2. Equilibrium state. Next, we introduce the Gibbs state of the reservoir at inverse temperature β, 0 < β < ∞.
It is given by the density matrix
ρR,β :=
1
ZR,β
e−βHR ,
where ZR,β = TrR[e−βHR] ,
(2.4)
where TrR[ · ] denotes the trace over HR.
An alternative way to describe this density matrix is to specify the expectation values of arbitrary observables,
which we denote by ⟨O⟩ρR,β := TrR [OρR,β]. For ϕ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗), we write ax(ϕ) = P
q∈¯Λ∗ϕ(q)ax,q, and we choose
observables, O, to be polynomials in the operators ax(ϕ). One then ﬁnds that, for any x, x′ and ϕ, ϕ′ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗):
1 Later, we will consider T Λ as an operator on ℓ2(Zd) by the natural embedding of ℓ2(Λ) into ℓ2(Zd). As such, it has the kernel
T Λ(x, x′) =
(
ˆǫ(x −x′) ,
if
x, x′ ∈Λ
0
else
,
(2.2)
i.e., we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions.

where Pair(n) denotes the set of partitions of {1, . . . , 2n} into n pairs and the product is over these pairs
(r, s), with the convention that r < s. Here, # stands either for ∗or nothing.
2.4. The interaction.We deﬁne the Hilbert space of state vectors of the coupled system (particle and reservoirs)
by
H := HS ⊗HR .
We pick a smooth ‘structure factor’ φ ∈L2(Rd) and we deﬁne its ﬁnite volume version φΛ ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗) by
φΛ(q) := (2π/L)d/2φ(q), with the normalization chosen such that ∥φ∥L2(Rd) =
lim
L→∞∥φΛ∥ℓ2(¯Λ∗). We will drop
the superscript Λ. The interaction between the particle and the reservoir at site x is given by
1x ⊗Ψx(φ),
where
Ψx(φ) = ax(φ) + a∗
x(φ)
is the ﬁeld operator, and
1x = |x⟩⟨x| denotes the projection onto the lattice site x. The interaction Hamiltonian
is taken to be
HSR :=
X
x∈Λ
1x ⊗Ψx(φ)
on
HS ⊗HR .
The total Hamiltonian of the interacting system on H is then given by
H := T ⊗
1 −λ2χ · X ⊗
1 +
1 ⊗HR + λHSR ,
(2.8)
where λ ∈R is a coupling constant. The interaction term HSR is relatively bounded w.r.t. HS+HR with arbitrarily
small relative bound. It follows that H is essentially selfadjoint on the domain HS ⊗Dom(HR), (where Dom(HR)
denotes the domain of HR).
2.5. Eﬀective dynamics. The time-evolution in the Schr¨odinger picture is given by
ρt = e−itHρ eitH ,
ρ ∈B1(H ) .
We will usually choose an initial state ρ of the form ρ = ρS ⊗ρR,β, with ρR,β as deﬁned above. Of course, ρt, with
t > 0, will in general not be a simple tensor product, but we can always take the partial trace, TrR[ · ], over HR
to obtain the ‘reduced density matrix’ ρS,t of the system;
ρS,t = TrR

e−itH(ρS ⊗ρR,β)eitH
=: Z[0,t]ρS ,
and we call Z[0,t] : B1(HS) →B1(HS) : ρS 7→ρS,t the reduced or eﬀective dynamics. It is a trace-preserving and
completely positive map.
In the present paper, we will mainly consider observables of the form O ⊗
1 with O ∈B(HS), in which case
we can also write
⟨O(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := Tr[O(t)ρS ⊗ρR,β] = TrS[OρS,t] ,
(2.9)
where the trace Tr[ · ] is over the Hilbert space H , the trace TrS[ · ] is over the particle Hilbert space HS and O(t)
is the Heisenberg picture time evolution of the observable O ⊗
1, i.e.,
O(t) := eitH(O ⊗
1) e−itH .
(2.10)
Note that O(t) is, in general, not of the product form O′ ⊗
1, for some O′.

2.6. Time-reversal. We deﬁne an anti-linear time-reversal operator Θ = ΘS ⊗ΘR, where ΘS is given by
ΘSf(x) = f(x) ,
f ∈ℓ2(Λ) ,
and ΘR by ΘR := Γs(θR), with the one-particle operator θR given by
θRϕx(q) = ϕx(−q) ,
ϕx ∈ℓ2(¯Λ∗) ,
x ∈Λ .
If the dispersion law ε of the particle and the form factor φ are invariant under time-reversal, i.e., ε(k) = ε(−k),
φ(q) = φ(−q) (as will be assumed) then we have that
ΘHχ=0Θ = Hχ=0 ,
expressing time-reversal invariance of the model.
3. Assumptions and Results
3.1. Assumptions.The model introduced in the last section is parametrized by two functions: the dispersion
law ε : Td →R, and the form factor φ : Rd →C. Here, we formulate our assumptions on these two functions.
The (multi-) strip Vδ is deﬁned by
Vδ := {z ∈(T + iT)d : | Im z| ≤δ} .
(3.1)
Assumption A.
[Particle dispersion] The function ε extends to an analytic function in a region containing a
strip Vδ, δ > 0. In particular, the norm
∥ε∥∞,δ := sup
p∈Vδ
|ε(p)|
is ﬁnite, for some δ > 0. Furthermore, there does not exist any v ∈Rd such that the function
Td ∋k 7→(v, ∇ε(k))
vanishes identically.
This assumption allows us to estimate the free particle propagator e−itHS on the particle Hilbert space
HS = ℓ2(ΛL) as follows:
 e−itHS
(x, x′)
 ≤Ce−ν|x−x′|et∥Im ε∥∞,ν .
(3.2)
For L = ∞, the bound (3.2) is the Combes-Thomas bound; for ﬁnite L, it can be established in an analogous
way. If we replace Zd by Rd, any physically acceptable dispersion law ε is unbounded, and there is no exponential
decay in |x −x′|. This is the main reason why the system studied in this paper is deﬁned on a lattice.
The next assumption deals with the ‘time-dependent’ correlation function deﬁned (in ﬁnite-volume) as
ˆψΛ(t) :=
X
q∈¯Λ∗
|φΛ(q)|2
 e−itω(q)
eβω(q) −1 +
eitω(q)
1 −e−βω(q)

,
(3.3)
and in the thermodynamic limit as
ˆψ(t) :=
Z
dq |φ(q)|2
 e−it|q|
eβ|q| −1 +
eit|q|
1 −e−β|q|

.
(3.4)
Since the correlation function ˆψ is determined by the form factor φ, the following assumption is in fact a constraint
on the choice of φ. Deﬁne the strip Hβ by
Hβ := {z ∈C : 0 ≤Im z ≤β} .
(3.5)
8

Assumption B. [Decay of reservoir correlation function] The form factor φ is a spherically symmetric function,
i.e., φ(q) =: φ(|q|). The correlation functions ˆψΛ(z), ˆψ(z) are uniformly bounded in Λ and z ∈Hβ, and
limΛ ˆψΛ(z) = ˆψ(z)
holds uniformly on compacts in Hβ, where limΛ stands for limL→∞(recall that Λ ≡ΛL). Furthermore, the
number
X
q∈¯Λ∗
ω(q)−1|φΛ(q)|2
(3.6)
is bounded uniformly in Λ. Most importantly, ˆψ(z) is continuous on Hβ and
| ˆψ(z)| ≤C e−gR|z| ,
z ∈Hβ .
This assumption mainly states that the reservoirs exhibit exponential loss of memory. This is a key ingredient
for our analysis.
Often, one also considers the ‘spectral density’
ψ(ω) = 1
2π
Z ∞
−∞
dt ˆψ(t) eitω .
(3.7)
It satisﬁes the so-called ‘detailed balance’ property eβωψ(ω) = ψ(−ω), which expresses, physically, that the
reservoir is in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature β.
Assumptions A and B are henceforth required and will not be repeated.
3.2. Thermodynamic limit.Up to this point, we have considered a system in a ﬁnite volume (cube), Λ or ¯Λ,
characterized by its linear size L. However, if we wish to study dissipative eﬀects, we must, of course, pass to
the thermodynamic limit, in order to eliminate ﬁnite-volume eﬀects such as Poincar´e recurrence. This amounts
to taking Λ = Zd, ¯Λ = Rd and is accomplished below.
In this section, we will explicitly put a label Λ on all quantities referring to a system in a ﬁnite volume.
As an example, HS now stands for ℓ2(Zd), and we write H Λ
S
for ℓ2(Λ). The shorthand limΛ stands for the
thermodynamic limit, limL→∞.
3.2.1. Observables of the system.We begin by deﬁning some classes of inﬁnite-volume system observables, (i.e.,
certain types of bounded operators on HS). We say that an operator O ∈B(HS) is exponentially localized
whenever
|O(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x|+|x′|),
for some ν > 0 .
An important rˆole is played by the so-called quasi-diagonal operators. These are operators O ∈B(HS) with the
property that
|O(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x−x′|),
for some ν > 0 .
We denote by
◦
A the class of quasi-diagonal operators and by A its norm-closure.
An observable O ∈B(HS) is said to be translation-invariant whenever TyO = O, for arbitrary y ∈Zd, where
TyO(x, x′) := O(x + y, x′ + y). Translation-invariant operators on HS form a commutative C∗-algebra denoted
by Cti. We also introduce the algebras
◦
Ati := Cti ∩
◦
A ,
Ati := Cti ∩A .
An operator O ∈Cti/
◦
Ati/Ati can be identiﬁed with a multiplication operator, Mf, on the Hilbert space L2(Td),
i.e., Mfg = fg, g ∈L2(Td), with f : Td 7→C a bounded and measurable/real-analytic/continuous function.
Physically, the variable in Td is the momentum of the particle.
These classes of operators are introduced because certain expansions used in our analysis will apply to quasi-
diagonal operators or translation-invariant quasi-diagonal operators, and they can be extended to the closures of
these algebras by density.
In analyzing diﬀusion and in the proof of the Einstein relation we also need to consider certain observables
that are unbounded operators: We introduce the ∗-algebra X that consists of polynomials in the components, Xi,
i = 1, . . . , d, of the particle-position operator X.
Given an inﬁnite-volume observable O ∈B(HS), HS = ℓ2(Zd), or O ∈X, we associate an observable
OΛ =
1ΛO
1Λ on H Λ
S = ℓ2(Λ) with it, where
1Λ is the orthogonal projection ℓ2(Zd) →ℓ2(Λ).

3.2.2. Dynamics.
We choose not to construct directly the time-evolution of inﬁnite-volume observables and
inﬁnite-volume states, although this could be done by using the Araki-Woods representation of the system in
the thermodynamic limit. Instead, we will analyze the inﬁnite-volume dynamics of ‘reduced’ states, i.e., of states
restricted to particle observables and correlation (Green) functions of particle-observables by constructing these
objects as thermodynamic limits of ﬁnite-volume expressions.
An inﬁnite-volume density matrix of the particle system ρS ∈B1(HS) is called exponentially localized if
|ρS(x, x′)| ≤Ce−ν(|x|+|x′|) ,
for some ν > 0 .
(3.8)
Given such an inﬁnite-volume density matrix ρS, we associate ﬁnite-volume density matrices
ρΛ
S :=
1
ZΛ
ρS
1ΛρS
1Λ ∈B1(H Λ
S ) ,
ZΛ
ρS := TrS[1ΛρS
1Λ] ,
(3.9)
with it. Note that, due to the normalization by ZΛ
ρS, ρΛ
S is a density matrix on H Λ
S .
Recall the deﬁnition of the reduced dynamics, ZΛ
[0,t], introduced in Section 2.5, and set
Z[0,t]ρS := limΛZΛ
[0,t]ρΛ
S .
(3.10)
The next lemma asserts that the thermodynamic limit (as Λ and ¯Λ increase to Zd, Rd, respectively) in (3.10)
exists, and that the resulting reduced dynamics Z[0,t] is translation-invariant.
Lemma 3.1. The limit on the right side of Equation (3.10) exists in B1(HS), and this deﬁnes the map Z[0,t] :
B1(HS) →B1(HS). The map Z[0,t] preserves the trace, i.e., TrS[Z[0,t]ρS] = TrS[ρS], positivity and exponential
localization of the state of the particle, i.e., if ρS has any of these properties, then so does Z[0,t]ρS. Moreover,
Z[0,t] is translation-invariant; T−yZ[0,t]Ty = Z[0,t] for y ∈Zd with Ty as in Subsection 3.2.1. As a consequence
of the above, for O in A or X, and for an exponentially localized state ρS, we can deﬁne
⟨O(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := TrS[OZ[0,t]ρS] .
3.3. Results.Next, we summarize our main results. Throughout this section, it is understood that we consider
the inﬁnite-volume system; i.e., Λ = Zd, ¯Λ = Rd.
Our ﬁrst result describes the approach of the state of the system to a ‘non-equilibrium stationary state’
(NESS), in the limit of large times.
In the theorems below, we use the notation O(t) for Oχ(t), even if χ ̸= 0. Recall also the multiplication
operator Mf on L2(Td) deﬁned in Section 3.2.
Theorem 3.2. [Approach to NESS] There are constants kλ, kχ, g > 0, such that, for 0 < |λ| < kλ, |χ| < kχ,
there exists a real-analytic function ζ ≡ζχ,λ on Td, satisfying ζ ≥0 and
R
Td dk ζ(k) = 1, i.e., ζ is a probability
density, such that the following statements hold for any exponentially localized density matrix, ρS, and continuous
function f : Td →R:
i. For χ ̸= 0,
1
T
Z T
0
dt ⟨Mf(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨f, ζχ,λ⟩L2(Td) + O(1/T ) ,
as T →∞.
(3.11)
ii. For χ ≡0,
⟨Mf(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨f, ζ0,λ⟩L2(Td) + O(e−λ2gt) ,
as t →∞,
(3.12)
and ζ0,λ satisﬁes ‘time reversal invariance’; ζ0,λ(k) = ζ0,λ(−k).
Our next result asserts that the motion of the particle is diﬀusive around an average uniform motion (i.e., a
drift at a constant velocity).
Theorem 3.3. [Diﬀusion] Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 3.2,
lim
t→∞
1
t ⟨X(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = v(χ) ,
10

where v(χ) is the ‘asymptotic velocity’ of the particle and is given by v(χ) = ⟨∇ε, ζχ,λ⟩. For χ ̸= 0, we have
v(χ) ̸= 0. The dynamics of the particle is diﬀusive, in the sense that the limits
Dij(χ) := lim
T →∞
1
T 2
Z ∞
0
dt e−t
T ⟨(Xi(t) −vi(χ)t)(Xj(t) −vj(χ)t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β
(3.13)
exist, where the ‘diﬀusion tensor’ D(χ) is positive-deﬁnite, with D(χ) = O(λ−2), as λ →0.
Note that the claim about the asymptotic velocity follows formally from Theorem 3.2 by deﬁning the velocity
operator as
V j := i[H, Xj] = i[T, Xj] = M∇jε ,
(3.14)
and writing X(t) = X(0) +
R t
0 dsV (s). Although it is quite easy to make this reasoning precise, we warn the
reader that, at this point, it is formal, because the Heisenberg-picture observables X(t) and V (t) have not been
constructed as operators in the thermodynamic limit. They are formal objects appearing in correlation functions
that are constructed as thermodynamic limits of ﬁnite-volume correlation functions.
3.4. Correlation functions and Einstein relation.
In this section, we present some more results on our
model, that are proven in [6]. We begin with introducing correlation functions. Let O1, O2 be two observables, i.e.,
O1, O2 belong to the algebras A or X; see Section 3.2. For Λ = ΛL, with L ∈2N, we set OΛ
i =
1ΛOi
1Λ. Similarly,
given an exponentially localized density matrix ρS ∈B1(ℓ2(Zd)), its ﬁnite-volume version ρΛ
S ∈B1(ℓ2(Λ)) is
deﬁned in (3.9). Let t1, t2 ∈R, then we deﬁne the (ﬁnite-volume) correlation function as
⟨OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
S ⊗ρΛ
R,β := Tr[OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)(ρΛ
S ⊗ρΛ
R,β)] ,
(3.15)
the trace being over the Hilbert space ℓ2(Λ) ⊗L2(¯Λ). The inﬁnite-volume correlation function is deﬁned as the
limit
⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β := limΛ Tr[OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)(ρΛ
S ⊗ρΛ
R,β)] ,
(3.16)
and we claim that this limit exists for any exponentially localized ρS and any O1, O2 in A or X. We refer to [6]
for a proof of this claim.
Apart from an initial state (density matrix) of the product form ρS ⊗ρR,β, we also consider the Gibbs state
of the coupled system when the external force ﬁeld vanishes, χ = 0. In ﬁnite volume, it is deﬁned by
ρΛ
β :=
1
ZΛ
β
e−βHχ=0,
ZΛ
β = Tr e−βHχ=0,
Hχ=0 = T ⊗
1 +
1 ⊗HR + λHSR ,
and one easily checks that ρΛ
β ∈B1(ℓ2(Λ) ⊗L2(¯Λ)). We then deﬁne, for O1, O2 as above,
⟨OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
β := Tr[OΛ
1 (t1)ρΛ
β] ,
(3.17)
⟨OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
β := Tr[OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)ρΛ
β] .
(3.18)
One observes that, for χ = 0, ⟨OΛ
2 (t2+t)OΛ
1 (t1+t)⟩ρΛ
β = ⟨OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)⟩ρΛ
β , for any t, i.e., the correlation functions
are time-translation invariant. More generally, one checks that, for χ = 0, the correlation function (3.18) satisﬁes
the KMS condition. In particular, we have that
⟨O1(t1)O2(t2)⟩ρΛ
β = ⟨O2(t2)O1(t1 + iβ)⟩ρΛ
β ,
(χ = 0) .
(3.19)
For O1, O2 ∈Ati, the inﬁnite-volume versions of (3.17) and (3.18) are well-deﬁned as the limits
⟨O1(t1)⟩ρβ := limΛ Tr[OΛ
1 (t1)ρΛ
β] ,
⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ := limΛ Tr[OΛ
2 (t2)OΛ
1 (t1)ρΛ
β] .
(3.20)
Note that we construct the thermodynamic limit of equilibrium correlation functions only for translation-invariant
observables, since, pictorially, the particle is uniformly distributed in space and hence the expectation values of
localized observables vanish. For more details we refer to [6].
11

Before we discuss the Einstein relation, let us mention that our model relaxes exponentially fast to equilibrium
at vanishing external ﬁeld; cf., Theorem 3.3. in [6]: For O1, O2 ∈Ati, t1, t2 ∈R+, there is g > 0, such that
⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = ⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ + O(e−λ2gt1) ,
(t2 > t1) ,
(3.21)
as t1 →∞, for λ suﬃciently small and χ = 0. Moreover, the equilibrium correlation functions (3.18) exhibit the
following ‘exponential cluster property’:
⟨O2(t2)O1(t1)⟩ρβ = ⟨O2⟩ρβ⟨O1⟩ρβ + O(e−λ2g(t2−t1)) ,
(3.22)
as t2 −t1 →∞, for λ suﬃciently small and χ = 0.
Finally, we mention that the equilibrium correlation
function (3.20) satisﬁes the KMS condition on the algebra Ati of translation-invariant observables; cf., Lemma 3.2
in [6]. Of course, there is nothing special about the restriction to correlation functions with one or two observables
and one can prove the statements above for any number of observables.
Our next result states that the equilibrium diﬀusion matrix D(χ = 0) (which is in fact a multiple of the
identity matrix) is related to the response of the particle’s motion to the ﬁeld χ. The corresponding identity is
known as the ‘Einstein relation’:
Theorem 3.4. [Einstein relation] Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 3.2,
∂
∂χi

χ=0
vj(χ) = λ2βDij(χ = 0) ,
(3.23)
where D(χ = 0) is deﬁned in Equation (3.13) and it equals
Dij(χ = 0) = 1
2
Z
R
dt ⟨V i(t)V j⟩ρβ .
Note that, by the positivity and isotropy of the diﬀusion matrix, this theorem also shows that, for small but
non-zero χ, v(χ) does not vanish. The origin of the unfamiliar factor λ2 on the right side of (3.23) is found in
the fact that the driving force ﬁeld in the Hamiltonian is λ2χ, rather than χ.
4. Strategy of proofs and discussion
Before we are able to present a comprehensible overview of the strategy of the proofs, we have to introduce some
further notions and concepts, such as the ﬁber decomposition introduced next.
4.1. Fiber decomposition.To start with, we note that B1(HS) ⊂B2(HS), HS = ℓ2(Zd). Hence, we may view
density matrices on HS as elements of the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, B2(HS) ≃L2(Td × Td, dkldkr).
We deﬁne
bO(kl, kr) :=
1
(2π)d
X
xl,xr∈Zd
O(xl, xr)e−ikl·xl+ikr·xr ,
O ∈B2(ℓ2(Zd)) .
In what follows, we write O for bO. To cope with the translation-invariance of our model, we make the following
change of variables
k := kl + kr
2
,
p := kl −kr ,
and, for a.a. p ∈Td, we obtain a well-deﬁned function Op ∈L2(Td) by putting
(Op)(k) := O(k + p
2, k −p
2) .
(4.1)
This follows from the fact that the Hilbert space B2(HS) ≃L2(Td × Td, dkldkr) can be represented as a direct
integral
B2(HS) ≃
Z ⊕
Td dp Hp ,
O =
Z ⊕
Td dp Op ,
(4.2)
12

where each ‘ﬁber space’ Hp can be identiﬁed with L2(Td). Next, we deﬁne, for θ = (θl, θr) ∈Cd×Cd, operators Jθ
by
Jθ O := e−i(θl,X)O e−i(θr,X) ,
O ∈B(HS) .
(4.3)
Note that Jθ is unbounded if θ has an imaginary part.
Also note that a density matrix ρS ∈B2(HS) is
exponentially localized iﬀ∥JθρS∥2 < ∞, for θ = (θl, θr) in some complex neighborhood of (0, 0).
The following lemma captures some identities used later on. Recall the deﬁnition of the strip Vδ in (3.1).
Lemma 4.1. Let O ∈B1(HS), then
TrS[O eip·X] = ⟨1, Op⟩L2(Td) =
Z
Td dk Op(k) ,
p ∈Td .
(4.4)
If there is a δ > 0 such that ∥Jθ/2O∥2 < ∞, for |θ| ≤δ, then p 7→Op is analytic in the interior of the strip Vδ.
(In the discussion above, for O ∈B2(HS) the ﬁber operator Op was deﬁned for a.a. p, but in the context
of Lemma (4.1), Op can be deﬁned for any p.) The ﬁrst statement of the lemma follows from the singular-
value decomposition for trace-class operators and standard properties of the Fourier transform.
The second
statement of Lemma (4.1) is the Paley-Wiener theorem, i.e., the relation between exponential decay of functions
and analyticity of their Fourier transforms; see [19].
The ﬁber decomposition in Equation (4.2) is useful when one deals with operators A acting on B2(HS) that
are translation invariant (TI), i.e., TzAT−z = A, with Tz deﬁned as in Section 3.2. An important example of a TI
operator A is the reduced time-evolution Z[0,t]; see Lemma 3.1. For TI operators A, we ﬁnd that (AO)p depends
on Op only, and hence it makes sense to write
(AO)p = ApOp ,
A =
Z ⊕
Td dp Ap .
(4.5)
Similarly to Lemma 4.1 above, we ﬁnd that, if Jθ/2AJ−θ/2 is bounded for all θ = (θl, θr), with |θ| ≤δ, then
the map p 7→Ap is analytic in a strip Vδ. Or, in other words, the kernel of the operator A, satisﬁes
|A(xl, xr, x′
l, x′
r)| ≤Ce−ν|xl−x′
l|−ν|xr−x′
r| ,
for ν < |θ|/2 ,
(xl, xr, x′
l, x′
r ∈Zd) .
(4.6)
In particular, (4.6) means that A preserves the subspace of exponentially localized operators in B2(HS). We call
such an A a quasi-diagonal operator on B2(HS).
4.2. Strategy of proofs of main results.
4.2.1. Kinetic theory. For small values of the coupling constant λ, one can, at least heuristically, understand the
model studied in this paper with the help of semiclassical kinetic theory. The reasoning proceeds as follows: If λ
approaches zero one must wait a time of order λ−2 before one sees an eﬀect of the particle-reservoir interactions.
The eﬀect is that the particle emits or absorbs a ﬁeld quantum (i.e., a ‘photon’ or ‘phonon’) of one of the thermal
reservoirs and thus changes its momentum. Since such emission/absorption processes are well separated in time,
one can assume them to be independent, and this leads to a description of the particle motion in terms of a
stochastic process. Since the maximal velocity of the particle is bounded (this is an eﬀect of the lattice) and of
order one, despite the presence of the driving ﬁeld χ, the particle travels a distance of order λ−2 during a time
of order λ−2. This motivates the introduction of the kinetic scale: We deﬁne ‘macroscopic’ variables, (ξ, τ), by
setting ξ := λ2x and τ := λ2t, where the variables (x, t) are the variables used in the deﬁnition of the model,
henceforth called ‘microscopic’ variables. The fact that, for small enough λ, our model is ‘well-described’ by
kinetic theory can be expressed, impressionistically, as follows:

Stochastic evolution (ξ, τ) .
The stochastic evolution appearing on the right side is discussed next.
13

4.2.2. Boltzmann equation.Consider a classical particle with position ξ ∈Rd and (quasi-) momentum k ∈Td.
The momentum k evolves according to a Poisson process with rate r(k, k′)dk′ for a jump from momentum k to
momentum k′, where r(k, k′) is given by
r(k, k′) := ψ[ε(k′) −ε(k)] ,
(4.7)
and ψ is the spectral density given in Equation (3.7). Between two consecutive jumps, at times τ and τ + ∆τ,
the momentum grows linearly in time k(τ + ∆τ) = k(τ) + χ∆τ (where addition is deﬁned on the torus Td). The
change in position is governed by the (group-) velocity ∇ε(k):
ξ(τ + ∆τ) = ξ(τ) +
Z τ+∆τ
τ
ds ∇ε(k(s)) .
From this, a Markov process on Rd × Td can be constructed using standard methods.
We present here the
associated Master Equation describing the time-evolution of the probability density, ντ(ξ, k) ≥0, on phase space
Rd × Td (with normalization R dξ R dk ντ(ξ, k) = 1):
∂
∂τ ντ(ξ, k) = (∇ε)(k) · ∇ξντ(ξ, k) −χ · ∇kντ(ξ, k) +
Z
Td dk′
r(k′, k)ντ(ξ, k′) −r(k, k′)ντ(ξ, k)

.
(4.8)
For our purposes, it is convenient to consider the Fourier transform
ˆντ(κ, k) :=
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd dξ e−i(κ, ξ) ντ(ξ, k) ,
where κ ∈Rd is the variable dual to ξ ∈Rd. One veriﬁes that ˆντ(κ, k) satisﬁes the evolution equation
∂
∂t ˆντ = M κ,χˆντ,
where, for smooth functions g on Td,
(M κ,χg)(k) := iκ · (∇ε)(k)g(k) −χ · ∇kg(k) +
Z
Td dk′r(k′, k)g(k′) −
Z
Td dk′r(k, k′)g(k) .
One can easily check that M κ,χ generates a strongly continuous semigroup on L2(Td). Its signiﬁcance in under-
standing dynamical properties of our model stems from the fact that it describes the evolution Z[0,λ−2τ] in the
ﬁber indexed by λ2κ, in the limit λ →0.
Theorem 4.2. [Kinetic limit] For any χ and arbitrary τ ≥0,
(Z[0,λ−2τ])λ2κ
−→
λ→0
eτMκ,χ ,
(4.9)
strongly on L2(Td).
The restriction to ﬁbers of order λ2 is equivalent to considering a macroscopic length scale ∼λ−2. One can
also convince oneself that (ρ)λ2κ ∈L2(Td) (the space which the operator on the left side of (4.9) acts on) is the
rescaled Wigner transform of ρ ∈B2(HS), and one may check that the claim (4.9) is equivalent to the results
in [11].
4.2.3. Perturbation around the kinetic limit. The strategy we follow to control the long-time behavior when λ is
small but non-zero, is basically the same as in [20]: We represent the Laplace transform of the ﬁbered dynamics
(Z[0,λ−2τ])λ2κ as a small (in λ) perturbation of the resolvent of the Boltzmann generator M κ,χ. This is accom-
plished by appropriately resumming diagrams, and this is the tedious part of our analysis, which is described
in [6]. The ideas underlying this analysis are elementary, and our technique is actually a time-dependent coun-
terpart of the use of ‘translation-analyticity in the spectral form factor’ ﬁrst applied to the study of ‘conﬁned’
open quantum systems by [14]. Later, these conﬁned open quantum systems, where the particle does not have
translational degrees of freedom, have been treated in greater generality; see [1, 8, 18].
A complication not present in [20], is that we need to keep track of the dependence of the poles in the Laplace
transform on λ, κ, χ. However, the Hamiltonian at χ ̸= 0 is not relatively bounded w.r.t. the one at χ = 0. This
means that we need to develop some version of asymptotic (rather than analytic) perturbation theory, and this
is done in Section 7.

4.2.4. Einstein relation.In this subsection, we derive the Einstein relation in ﬁnite volume (now dropping the
superscript Λ, because all formulae of this subsection refer to a ﬁnite volume). We deﬁne the velocity operator as
V j := i[H, Xj] = i[T, Xj] .
(4.10)
Note that, because of the ﬁnite lattice, this operator is not translation-invariant; however, its thermodynamic
limit is. Using Duhamel’s principle we obtain

⟨V j,χ(t)⟩ρβ = −iλ2

(4.11)
For simplicity, we drop the spatial indices i, j in the following.
Note that the right-hand side of (4.11) is
independent of χ.
By stationarity of the state ρβ, it can be written as −iλ2 R t
0 ds ⟨[X0(−s), V ]⟩ρβ.
In the
remainder of this section, we always set χ = 0 and we drop this symbol from our notation. Using the KMS

where, in the second line, we have used that the integral of the function z 7→⟨XV (z)⟩β vanishes along the contour
0, t, t + iβ, iβ, 0. The third line follows by time-translation invariance. Next, using X(−t) =

response (left-hand side) to an equilibrium correlation function (right-hand side).
5. Kinetic limit: Linear Boltzmann evolution
As announced in the previous section, we have to study the operator M ≡M κ,χ introduced in Subsection 4.2.2,
in order to unravel properties of the long-time dynamics of the particle. This operator is of the form
M κ,χ = iκ · (∇ε) −χ · ∇+ G + L ,
(5.1)
15

with the gain- and loss terms given by
(Gg)(k) :=
Z
Td dk′r(k′, k)g(k′) ,
(Lg)(k) := −
Z
Td dk′r(k, k′)g(k) .
The operator M κ,χ is closable (as an operator deﬁned on a domain dense in L2(Td)), because it is a bounded
perturbation of the anti-selfadjoint operator χ · ∇, a core being, e.g., C∞(Td). Our main aim is to control the
spectrum of M κ,χ and to establish good bounds on the resolvent (z−M κ,χ)−1. In our analysis, we will emphasize
the usefulness of the C0-semigoup generated by M κ,χ.
5.1. Concepts from the theory of C0-semigroups.First, we recall some deﬁnitions and results from the
theory of strongly continuous semigroups (hereafter C0-semigroups). For a detailed discussion we refer to [10, 13].
For deﬁniteness, we assume from the onset that the semigroup acts on L2(Td). We say that f ∈L2(Td) is positive
(f ≥0), or strictly positive (f > 0) iﬀf(k) ≥0, or f(k) > 0, respectively, for almost every k ∈Td.
A C0-semigroup (Tt)t≥0 is called
– positivity-preserving (or positive) if 0 ≤f implies 0 ≤Ttf, for each t ≥0;
– positivity-improving if 0 ≤f, f ̸≡0, implies 0 < Ttf, for each t > 0.
For a C0-semigroup (Tt)t≥0, the growth bound, ω0, is deﬁned by
ω0 := inf{ω ∈R : ∃Kω, with 1 ≤Kω < ∞, such that ∥Tt∥≤Kωeωt , ∀t ≥0 }.
Here and in the following we use the symbol ∥·∥for the norm on L2(Td) and for the operator norm on B(L2(Td)).
A C0-semigroup (Tt)t≥0 has a closed generator, A, and we use the standard notation Tt = etA. The spectral
bound, s(A), of A is deﬁned as
s(A) := sup{Re z : z ∈σ(A)} ,
where σ(A) is the spectrum of A. For any z ∈C with Re z > ω0, (z −A)−1 =
R ∞
0
dt e−zt Tt exists, and we infer
the bound ∥(z −A)−1∥≤
Kω0
Rez−ω0 and the inequality s(A) ≤ω0.
Let O be a densely deﬁned closed operator whose spectrum is not all of C. We say (following [4], see also [15])
that z ∈C belongs to the essential spectrum, σess(O), of O, iﬀz
1 −O is not a Fredholm operator. We call
ress(O) = sup{|z| : z ∈σess(O)} the essential spectral radius.
A C0-semigroup Tt is called quasi-compact if
ress(Tt) < 1, for t > 0.
5.2. Spectral analysis of M 0,χ: Preliminaries. For now, we neglect the advection term iκ · (∇ǫ), i.e., we
put κ = 0, and study M 0,χ = −χ · ∇+ G + L. We therefore omit the superscript κ everywhere in this section,
and we simply write M χ ≡M 0,χ. Our main results are summarized in Lemma 5.2.
We say that a function f on Td is real-analytic if it is analytic in a region containing a multistrip Vδ, for
some δ > 0. Starting from Assumptions A and B, it is straightforward to verify that function r(k, k′), as deﬁned
in (4.7), is real-analytic in k and k′, for some δ > 0 determined by gR and δε. Moreover, r(k, k′) is strictly
positive almost everywhere for real arguments. Thus the functions r(·, k′), r(k, ·) can vanish only in isolated
points. Therefore,
a0 := inf
k∈Td
Z
dk′r(k, k′) > 0 .
(5.2)
Setting L(k) := −
R
dk′r(k, k′) (the loss operator L being deﬁned as multiplication by L(k)), we have that
L(k) ≤−a0, for all k ∈Td. The strict positivity of the rates r(·, ·) implies that the gain operator G is positivity
improving. Moreover, by the smoothness of r(·, ·), G is a compact operator.
Lemma 5.1. The operator −χ · ∇+ L generates a positivity-preserving C0-semigroup (St)t≥0 on L2(Td) with
growth bound ω0 ≤−a0, and
∥(z + χ · ∇−L)−1∥≤|Re z + a0|−1 ,
for
Re z > −a0 .
(5.3)
The operator M 0,χ generates a positivity-improving C0-semigroup, (Tt)t≥0, on L2(Td). It has the constant func-
tion 1 as a left-eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1, i.e., ⟨1, Ttf⟩= ⟨1, f⟩, for all f ∈L2(Td) and all
t ≥0.
16

Proof. Deﬁne the C0-semigroup (St)t≥0 by
(Stf)(k) := f(k −χt)e
R t
0 ds L(k+χ(s−t)) ,
t ≥0 ,
f ∈L2(Td) .
(5.4)
It is easy to check that −χ·∇+L is the generator of (St)t≥0, and the growth bound of (St)t≥0 is smaller than −a0.
Since G is bounded, the construction of the semigroup (Tt)t≥0 is standard, e.g., by using the norm-convergent
Dyson series
Tt := St +
∞
X
n=1
Z
0≤t1<...tn≤t
dt1 . . . dtn St−tnGStn−tn−1G · · · St1 .
(5.5)
Clearly, we have that ∥Tt∥≤et(−a0+∥G∥). Observe that the semigroup (St)t≥0 deﬁned in Equation (5.4) has the
property that f > 0 implies Stf > 0, for any ﬁnite t ≥0. Together with the fact that G is positivity-improving,
this implies that (Tt)t≥0 is positivity-improving, for any t > 0. One easily checks that, for smooth f,
d
dt⟨1, ft⟩= −⟨1, χ · ∇ft⟩+ ⟨1, (G + L)ft⟩= 0 ,
ft := Ttf ,
(note that both terms vanish separately), and ⟨1, Ttf⟩= ⟨1, f⟩holds for arbitrary f ∈L2(Td), by a limiting
argument.
From this lemma, we obtain information on the spectrum of the generator M χ.
Lemma 5.2. [Spectrum of M χ] All statements below hold for any χ ∈Rd:
i. The essential spectrum of M χ is contained in the region {z ∈C : Re z ≤−a0}. Furthermore, the semigroup
generated by M χ is quasi-compact.
ii. Let z /∈σ(M χ). If f is real-analytic then (z −M χ)−1f is real-analytic, too.
iii. The spectrum of M χ in the region {z ∈C : Re z > −a0} consists of isolated eigenvalues of ﬁnite (algebraic)
multiplicity. The associated eigenvectors are real-analytic functions.
iv. There is a constant m > 0 (independent of χ) such that the region {z ∈C : | Im z| ≥m, Re z > −a0/2}
does not contain any spectrum.
v. The only eigenvalue µ of M χ with Re µ ≥0 is µ = 0, and it is simple. The spectral projection associated
with the eigenvalue µ = 0, P 0,χ ≡P χ, is of the form P χ = |ζχ⟩⟨1|, where ζχ is a strictly positive function,
with ⟨1, ζχ⟩= 1. Moreover, supχ ∥ζχ∥< ∞.
Proof. i. By Lemma 5.1, we know that s(−χ·∇+ L) = −a0. Since G is compact, Weyl’s theorem on the stability
of the essential spectrum implies σess(−χ · ∇+ L) = σess(−χ · ∇+ L + G). Moreover, compact perturbations of
generators with strictly negative growth bound generate quasi-compact semigroups; see [10].
ii. By the analyticity of the function r(k, k′) in a strip, we have that
∥eγ·∇M χe−γ·∇−M χ∥≤O(γ) ,
(5.6)
for suﬃciently small γ ∈Cd. Hence, by standard perturbation theory, eγ·∇(z −M χ)−1e−γ·∇remains bounded
for suﬃciently small γ (depending on z), for any z /∈σ(M χ), and hence
∥eγ·∇(z −M χ)−1f∥≤C(z, γ)∥eγ·∇f∥.
The claim on analyticity follows then from the Paley-Wiener theorem.
iii. For any z ∈C with Re z > −a0, we write
z −(−χ · ∇+ L + G) = (z −(−χ · ∇+ L))(1 −
1
z + χ · ∇−LG) .
It follows that z −(−χ·∇+L+G) is invertible if and only if (1−
1
z+χ·∇−LG) is. Since G is compact, the analytic
Fredholm theorem implies that (1−
1
z+χ·∇−LG)−1 is a meromorphic function with only ﬁnitely or countably many
17

isolated poles of ﬁnite (algebraic and geometric) multiplicity, the residues of which are ﬁnite rank operators. It
follows that the spectrum of M χ in the region {z ∈C : Re z > −a0} consists of isolated eigenvalues of ﬁnite
multiplicity. Let M χf = µf, f ̸≡0, with Re µ > −a0. Since µ ̸∈σ(−χ · ∇+ L), we can rewrite this eigenvalue
equation as
f = (µ + χ · ∇−L)−1Gf .
(5.7)
Consequently, for suﬃciently small γ ∈Cd,
∥eγ·∇f∥≤∥(µ + χ · ∇−eγ·∇Le−γ·∇)−1∥∥eγ·∇G∥∥f∥
≤
C
| Re µ −a0| + O(γ) ∥f∥.
(5.8)
Indeed, the bound on the resolvent follows by Neumann series expansion, using (5.6), with M χ replaced by L,
and the resolvent bound on (z + χ · ∇−L)−1 from Lemma 5.1, whereas the bound ∥eγ·∇G∥< ∞follows from
the analyticity of the kernel r(·, ·) of G. By the Paley-Wiener theorem, f is real-analytic.
iv. Let M χf = µf, with ∥f∥= 1. Then, on one hand,
| Im µ −⟨f, iχ · ∇f⟩| ≤| Re µ| + ∥(G + L)f∥.
(5.9)
On the other hand, by the functional calculus,
|⟨f, iχ · ∇f⟩| ≤1
ν ⟨f, eν|χ·∇|f⟩,
ν > 0 .
Since Re µ ≥−a0/2, the right-hand side of this equation can, for suﬃcient small ν, be bounded independently
of Im µ. This follows from statement iii and Equation (5.8). Combining this Im µ-independent bound with (5.9)
yields the claim iv.
v. The claim that there is a unique simple eigenvalue with maximal real part (and strictly positive eigen-
vector ζχ) follows from a Perron-Frobenius-type argument; see, e.g., Chapter 6, Thm 3.5, in [10]. This theorem
uses the quasi-compactness and the fact that, for suﬃciently large real z, (z −M 0,χ)−1 is positivity-improving,
which in our case follows from the fact that Tt is positivity-improving. The claim that this eigenvalue is zero,
follows then immediately from the relation ⟨1, Ttζχ⟩= ⟨1, ζχ⟩and the spectral mapping theorem for generators
of quasi-compact semigroups; see, e.g., Chapter 5, Theorem 4.7 in [10]. Finally, the uniformity in χ of the bound
on ∥ζχ∥follows from (5.8), applied to f = ζχ, since
∥ζχ∥≤∥(−χ · ∇+ L)−1∥∥Gζχ∥≤(1/a0) sup
k′ ∥r( · , k′)∥∥ζχ∥1 ,
where ∥ζχ∥1 :=
R
dk|ζχ| = ⟨1, ζχ⟩= 1, and we have used the explicit form of G.
5.3. Reﬁned spectral analysis of M χ = M 0,χ. In this subsection, we reﬁne the conclusions of Lemma 5.2.
The main diﬃculty we face is that the operator M χ is not analytic (in any reasonable sense) in the parameter χ,
and hence, a priori, perturbation theory does not apply to the isolated eigenvalue at 0 and the corresponding
eigenvector. This diﬃculty is overcome in the next lemma that shows that the resolvent and the spectrum of M χ
can be controlled in terms of M 0, for χ suﬃciently small. Note that this would be obvious if M χ were analytic
in χ. Afterwards, we also comment on the case of large χ.
Lemma 5.3. There are constants C , C′ such that

1
z −M χ
 ≤
C
|Re z + gM + O(χ)| + C′
|z| ,
for
Re z > −gM + O(χ) ,
(5.10)
as χ →0, where gM := dist(iR, σ(M 0) \ {0}).
In the proof of this lemma we make use of the transformation Bε := e
β
2 εBe−β
2 ε, for any operator B acting
on L2(Td). Here ε is the dispersion law of the particle. Since ε is positive and bounded, it immediately follows
that the spectra of Bε and B coincide. In particular, we will consider
M χ
ε = Gε + L + β
2 (χ · ∇ε) −χ · ∇.
(5.11)
18

This transformation is useful, because the rates satisfy the identity
r(k, k′) = r(k′, k) e−β(ε(k′)−ε(k)) ,
(5.12)
where β is the inverse temperature of the reservoirs. This identity is known as the detailed balance condition. It
is a consequence of the KMS condition for the reservoirs and the time-reversal symmetry; (recall the discussion
following Assumption B in Section 3.1). Equation (5.12) implies that Gε and Gε + L + β
2 (χ · ∇ε) are selfadjoint.
But note that −χ · ∇is anti-selfadjoint. By P χ we denote the spectral projection associated to the eigenvalue
µ = 0 of M χ, and we set ¯P χ :=
1−P χ. For χ = 0, we infer from the detailed balance condition that P 0 = |ζ0⟩⟨1|,
with ζ0 the ‘Gibbs state’ ζ0(k) =
1
⟨1,e−βε⟩e−βε(k). Finally, we note that P 0
ε and ¯P 0
ε are orthogonal projections.
Proof of Lemma 5.3. We split
(z −M χ)−1 = P χ(z −M χ)−1P χ + ¯P χ(z −M χ)−1 ¯P χ ,
and we remark that the ﬁrst term is bounded by
C
|z|, since the eigenvalue µ = 0 is simple and ∥ζχ∥is bounded
uniformly in χ, by Lemma 5.2, v. To deal with the second term, note that the left-eigenvector at µ = 0 does not
depend on χ, i.e., P χ = |ζχ⟩⟨1|, which implies
P χP χ′ = P χ ,
¯P χ ¯P χ′ = ¯P χ′ ,
P χ ¯P χ′ = 0 ,
(5.13)
(however, ¯P χP χ′ ̸= 0, for χ ̸= χ′). In particular, we have that
M χ = ¯P 0M χ ¯P 0 + ¯P 0M χP 0 ,
and, by straightforward algebra,
(z −M χ)−1 = z−1P 0 + ¯P 0(z ¯P 0 −¯P 0M χ ¯P 0)−1 ¯P 0 + ¯P 0(z ¯P 0 −¯P 0M χ ¯P 0)−1 ¯P 0M χP 0.
Using (5.13), this leads to
¯P χ(z −M χ)−1 ¯P χ = ¯P χ( ¯P 0(z −M χ) ¯P 0)−1 ¯P χ .
We recall the conjugation B →Bε, introduced above, and write
( ¯P 0
ε (z −M χ
ε ) ¯P 0
ε )−1 = (R + iI)−1 ,
where R is deﬁned by R := ¯P 0
ε (Re z −(G + L)ε + β
2 (χ · ∇ε)) ¯P 0
ε and I := ¯P 0
ε (Im z + iχ · ∇) ¯P 0
ε . Note that R and I
are selfadjoint operators. By the spectral calculus and the boundedness of χ · ∇ε,
R ≥Re z −gM + O(χ) .
Hence, R > 0 (strictly positive in the sense that inf σ(R) > 0), for Re z > gM + O(χ), and we ﬁnd that
(R + iI)−1 =
1

Using the selfadjointness of I, the boundedness of eβε/2 and P χ (uniform in χ), we obtain the bound
(z −M χ)−1 ¯P χ ≤C |gM + O(χ) + Re z|−1 ,
Re z > −gM + O(χ) .
As promised, we now turn to a discussion of the model for large χ. For simplicity, we restrict our attention
to the one-dimensional case, d = 1, and comment on higher dimensions at the end of this discussion.
Lemma 5.4. Let d = 1. There are constants C, C′ such that, for suﬃciently large |χ|,

1
z −M χ −1
z Q
 ≤C
|χ| ,
(5.14)
for z ∈C, with | Im z| ≤C′. Here Q is the orthogonal projection on the space of constant functions on T.
19

Proof. In d = 1, the spectrum of the self-adjoint operator χ · X is the lattice χ Z, and each of the eigenvalues
corresponds to a one-dimensional eigenspace. The eigenspace corresponding to 0 is the space of constant functions.
Hence, we may write
M χ = QM 0Q + ¯Q(χ · X) ¯Q + W ,
with
W = QM 0 ¯Q + ¯QM 0Q ,
and ¯Q =
1 −Q. As argued previously, Q(G + L) = 0 (the constant function is a left eigenvector of M χ). Since
¯Q(χ · X) ¯Q has spectrum in the region | Im z| ≥|χ| and W is bounded, we obtain the claim of the lemma by a
straightforward Neumann series expansion.
In higher dimensions, things are more subtle. If χ is a multiple of some element in Zd, then the above lemma
is easily generalized by replacing Q with the (inﬁnite-dimensional) projection corresponding to the kernel of χ·X
and the term 1
z Q in (5.14) by Q
1
z−QM0QQ. In this situation, the spectrum of χ · X is a lattice and the gap
between 0 and the rest of the spectrum increases proportionally to |χ|. Since the spectral analysis of QM 0Q can
be carried out similarly to that of M 0, this allows us to control the eigenvalue at 0 by perturbation theory, as
χ →∞. However, if the line χR does not hit any lattice point Zd, then the spectrum of χ · X covers the whole
real line and we need more subtle considerations to perform the limit χ →∞. This is expected to be manageable;
but we do not wish to address this point here.
5.4. Asymptotics of the semigroup etMχ.
In this section, we discuss the large time asymptotics of the
semigroup generated by M κ,χ. In particular, we show that the diﬀusion tensor at vanishing external ﬁeld is
positive-deﬁnite.
Our interest is in the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the linear Boltzmann equation, i.e., of the probability
density νt(x, k) satisfying the evolution Equation (4.8). The distribution ˆν0
t (k) :=
R
dx νt(x, k) of the particle’s
momentum evolves according to the semigroup etM0,χ. We recall that this semi-group is quasi-compact (and
positivity improving) and that µ = 0 is an isolated eigenvalue of M χ, by Lemma 5.2. Hence, we conclude (see,
e.g., [10]) that, for any ˆν0
t=0 ∈L2(Td),
ˆν0
t = ζχ + O(e−gM (χ)t) ,
t →∞,
where gM(χ) = dist(iR, σ(M 0,χ) \ {0}). We know that gM(χ) > 0, for all χ; but only for small χ we have
established uniformity in χ; see Lemma 5.3. Information on the distribution of the particle’s position is obtained
from operators on ﬁbers at non-zero κ, (as explained in Section 4). Hence we have to determine the asymptotic
behavior of etMκ,χ, for small κ. Recall that M κ,χ = M 0,χ + iκ · ∇ε. Since iκ · ∇ε is a bounded operator, analytic
perturbation theory in κ implies that the operator M κ,χ has an isolated, simple eigenvalue, uM(κ), close to 0, for
small κ ∈Cd. Moreover, by the resolvent bound in Lemma 5.3, gM(κ, χ) := dist(iR, σ(M 0,χ) \ {uM(κ)}) equals
gM(χ) + O(κ). For κ small enough, the semigroup generated by M κ,χ is quasi-compact, and we conclude, by
similar reasoning as above, that
etMκ,χ = P κ,χ
M etuM(κ,χ) + O(et(uM (κ,χ)−gM (κ,χ))) ,
with P κ,χ
M
a rank-one operator that is a small perturbation of |ζχ⟩⟨1|.
Following the discussion in Section 4, we know that the asymptotic velocity vM(χ) and diﬀusion constant
DM(χ) can be derived from uM, with
vi
M(χ) = i ∂
∂κi

κ=0
uM(κ, χ),
Dij
M(χ) = −1
2
∂
∂κi∂κj

κ=0
uM(κ, χ) .
These expressions can be computed using the standard Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger expansion of analytic perturbation
theory:
uM(κ, χ) = i⟨1, (κ, ∇ǫ)ζ0,χ⟩−⟨1, (κ, ∇ǫ)Sχ(κ, ∇ǫ)ζ0,χ⟩+ O(κ3) ,
|κ| →0 ,
where by Sχ we denote the ‘reduced resolvent’ of M 0,χ at z = 0, i.e., Sχ = (χ·∇−G−L)−1 ¯P χ, with ¯P χ =
1−P χ,
P χ = |ζχ⟩⟨1|. Note that uM(κ, χ) = uM(−κ, χ), so that vM(χ) and DM(χ) have real entries.
For χ = 0, the detailed balance condition implies that ζχ=0(k) ∝e−βǫ(k), hence vM(χ = 0) = 0. To prove
that the diﬀusion constant at vanishing external ﬁeld is strictly positive, we use the transformation B 7→Bǫ (as
deﬁned in Section 5.3) to ﬁnd that, for any a ∈Rd,
(a, DM(χ = 0)a) = −1
2⟨1, (a, ∇ǫ)S0(a, ∇ǫ)ζ0⟩= −
1
2⟨1, e−βǫ⟩⟨e−βǫ/2, (a, ∇ǫ)S0
ǫ (a, ∇ǫ)e−βǫ/2⟩.
20

By the spectral calculus and Lemma 5.2, we know that −S0
ǫ is strictly positive. Moreover, by Assumption A,
(a, ∇ǫ) does not vanish identically. It follows that DM(χ = 0) is a positive-deﬁnite matrix.
For χ ̸= 0, one can establish smoothness (but not analyticity) of uM(κ, χ), vM(χ) and DM(χ) in χ, using
asymptotic perturbation expansions in χ, for χ small enough. This method is outlined in Lemma 6.1 of [6]. Re-
lying on these expansions and using the ideas just presented, it is straightforward to prove that (χ, vM(χ)) ̸= 0,
for χ ̸= 0, and that DM(χ) > 0, for small external forces χ. Moreover, one can also conﬁrm the validity of the
Einstein relation within the kinetic theory:

χ=0vM(χ) = βDM(0).
Finally, let us turn to the large-χ regime. In dimension d = 1, Lemma 5.4 allows us to apply perturbation
theory in the parameter 1/|χ|, and we derive easily that both v(χ) and DM(χ) vanish as 1/|χ|, for |χ| →∞.
The main gap in our knowledge is for moderate |χ|: We are not able to prove that DM(χ) > 0. The fact that
this is diﬃcult using spectral methods should not come as a surprise. In fact, modern approaches to the central
limit theorem often use martingale techniques. However, a standard method we are aware of, which one may
want to apply to prove the positivity of the diﬀusion constant and a central limit type theorem, the graded sector
condition introduced in [16], does not appear to be applicable here.
6. Results from expansions
The aim of this section is to summarize properties of the eﬀective dynamics Z[0,t] that can be proven using
expansion techniques. We only describe the main ideas and present formal arguments. Mathematically precise
arguments are given in [6], Sections 4 and 5, where elaborate expansion techniques are developed that can also
be used to analyze correlation functions.
6.1. Survey of expansions. Here we sketch expansion techniques that are used to study the reduced dynamics
of the tracer particle. Let I ⊂R+ be a ﬁnite interval. We deﬁne the free particle dynamics, UΛ
I , on B2(HS),
with HS = ℓ2(Λ), by
UΛ
I := e−i|I|ad(HS) ,
HS ≡HΛ
S = T Λ −λ2χ · XΛ ,
(6.1)
and the particle-reservoir interaction, HSR(t) ≡HΛ
SR(t) in the interaction picture, which we may write as a sum
over spatially localized terms, by
HSR(t) := eitHR HSRe−itHR =

where t−(I), t+(I) denote the inﬁmum and supremum of the interval I, respectively. The trace over the reservoir
Hilbert space can be evaluated using Wick’s theorem; see (2.7). For this purpose, we introduce the shorthand
notations
1x,ς := (1x)ς ,
Ψx,ς(t) := (−iΨx(t))ς ,
for x ∈Λ, ς ∈{l, r} (the left- and right multiplications, ( · )ς, were introduced in (2.1)). We denote by Pair(n),
the set of pairings of 2n elements and denotes by x, ς elements of Λ2n, {l, r}2n, respectively. In this notation, the
formal Dyson series for ZI can, upon using Wick’s theorem, be written as

ˆψΛ(u −v) ,
if ς = l , ς′ = r .
(6.5)
The reservoir two-point correlation function ˆψΛ has been deﬁned in (3.3).
In the next step, we decompose the expansion (6.3) into a sum/integral over irreducible pairings: A pairing π
is irreducible whenever for any m = 1, . . . , 2n −1, there is a pair (r, s) ∈π such that s ≤m < r.
To that end, we deﬁne an operator VΛ

(6.7)
Representation (6.7) is the starting point for the proof of Lemma 3.1. The details of our proof can be found
in [6]; Section 5.1. Here we just indicate some of the main ideas underlying it: First, we recall the bound on UI
from (3.2):
|UΛ
I (x, y, x′, y′)| ≤Cect∥Im ǫ∥∞,νe−ν|x−x′|−ν|y−y′| ,
(6.8)
which holds uniformly in Λ ⊆Zd. We observe that Assumption A ensures that limΛUΛ
I = UI, in the sense of
convergence of kernels. Furthermore, the reservoir two-point correlation functions ΨΛ(t) and Ψ(t) are bounded
uniformly in t and Λ, and, by Assumption B, we have that limΛΨΛ(t) = Ψ(t), uniformly in t on compact subsets
of R. One then proves that VΛ
I deﬁnes a bounded operator on B2(HS), for any Λ, including Λ = Zd, and that
limΛVΛ
I = VI, in the sense of kernels. It is then straightforward to show that the expansion for ZΛ
I converges
absolutely in norm as an operator on B2(HS), the bounds being uniform in Λ, and that limΛZΛ
I has a limit ZI,
in the sense of convergence of kernels. Moreover, repeated use of (6.8) reveals that
|ZΛ
I (x, y, x′, y′)| ≤Ce−ν|x−x′|−ν|y−y′| ,
|ZI(x, y, x′, y′)| ≤Ce−ν|x−x′|−ν|y−y′| ,
(6.9)
for some ν > 0, where the constant C is independent of Λ ⊆Zd and is uniform in I, for I contained in compact
subsets of R. Thus, for any exponentially localized density matrix ρS ∈B1(HS) and any ﬁnite time t, we can
deﬁne
⟨O(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = TrS[OZ[0,t]ρS] := limΛ TrS[OΛZΛ
[0,t]ρΛ
S ] ,
(6.10)
where OΛ =
1ΛO
1Λ, with O ∈
◦
A or X. By the same reasoning, one also establishes that the inﬁnite-volume
objects are translation-invariant, i.e., A = T−yATy, for A = Z[0,t], UI, VI and y ∈Zd. This becomes plausible
if one recalls that translation-invariance in ﬁnite volume was broken only because of the Dirichlet boundary
condition.
22

The advantage of representation (6.7) over (6.3) is that, after Laplace transformation, it can be resummed:
For z ∈C, with Re z suﬃciently large, we deﬁne
R(z) :=
Z ∞
0
dt e−ztZ[0,t] .
(6.11)
In order to identify the leading contributions to Z[0,t] and R, respectively, we deﬁne an operator

Recalling the deﬁnition of ζ in (6.4) and of V and V(2), we observe that, roughly speaking, M(z) contains all
contributions to second order in λ from the correlation functions ζ, but higher orders of λ enter M(z) trough the
ﬁeld term λ2χ · X.
Recall the deﬁnition of the operator Jθ in (4.3).
Lemma 6.1. The operator-valued function (z, θ) 7→JθA(z)J−θ, with A = M, Rex is analytic in the region
|θ| < kθ, Re z > −kz, for some kz, kθ > 0, and satisﬁes the bounds (as λ →0)

∥JθM(z)J−θ∥

(6.14)
Moreover, for Re z > 0,
R(z) = (z −LS −M(z) −Rex(z))−1 ,
(6.15)
where LS = ad(HS) is the Liouvillian of the particle system.
The proof of this Lemma is contained in [6], Section 5.3. Here we just sketch the main key ideas. First, one
observes that the time integrals in (6.7) are convolutions. Thus, when taking the Laplace transform, it suﬃces to
consider the Laplace transforms of U[0,t] and V[0,t]. The former being given by the resolvent of LS = ad(HS), it
suﬃces to consider the operators V[0,t] −V(2)
[0,t] and V(2)
[0,t], respectively. The Laplace transform of V[0,t] −V(2)
[0,t] can
be computed explicitly (see below), and the claims concerning M in Lemma 6.1 can be checked easily. It remains
to analyze V(2)
[0,t], as deﬁned in (6.12). The sum over the spatial coordinates x in (6.12) can be bounded using the
Combes-Thomas bound for the propagators UI (see (3.2)), at the price of a ‘mild’ exponential growth in time; (it
is ‘mild’ because ν on the right hand side of (3.2) can be chosen arbitrarily small, as long as it does not depend
on λ). To bound the integrals over the time coordinates t, we use the exponential decay in time of the correlation
function ζ. We can cope with the ‘mild’ exponential growth coming from the sum over the spatial coordinates
by slightly reducing the decay rate in the exponential decay coming from the correlations ζ. Then we are left
with the problem of analyzing a one-dimensional ‘gas’ of pairings between points conﬁned to an interval of the
real line, with integrable (in fact, exponential) decay in the distance between points in each pair. It has been
remarked repeatedly that, for such systems, one can integrate over all times and sum over all possible pairings.
For more details, we refer to an earlier paper [20] and to the companion paper [6].
From here on, our analysis proceeds as follows: In the next subsection, we explicitly calculate the term M(z)
and show that, in some sense to be made precise, it is close to the generator M of the linear Boltzmann equation
discussed in Section 5. In a next step, carried out in Section 7, we show that R(z) is comparable to the resolvent
of M when restricted to ﬁbers corresponding to ‘small’ momenta.

(6.16)
We recall the ﬁber decomposition introduced in Section 4.1. Identifying the ﬁber spaces Hp with L2(Td), we
interpret M(z)p as an operator acting on L2(Td). The action of the unitary group e−itHS, with HS = T −λ2χ · X,
is given by
(e−itHSf)(k) = f(k −λ2χt)e−iΦk(t) ,
f ∈L2(Td) ,
(6.17)
where Φk(t) :=
R t
0 ds ε(k −λ2χs). We split M(z) into M(z) = P
ς1,ς2 Mς1,ς2(z), corresponding to the second
sum in (6.16). A tedious but straightforward calculation, using (6.17), yields the ﬁber operators

6.3. Analysis of ladder diagrams.The idea of our analysis is to expand the restrictions to the ﬁbers Hλ2κ of
the operators R(z), i.e., (R(z))λ2κ, for small z, around the contributions of order λ2. Note that, because of the
small ﬁber momentum, λ2κ, there are no contributions of order 1. To capture these contributions, we will deﬁne
an operator f
M ≡f
M λ,κ,χ acting on L2(Td) ≃Hλ2κ that satisﬁes
(LS + M(0) + Rex(0))λ2κ = λ2 f
M + O(λ4(1 + |κ|)) ,
(6.18)
as λ →0, κ →0. Note that we have set the spectral parameter z in M and Rex to zero. As the notation
suggests, f
M is closely related to M ≡M κ,χ, the operator introduced and analyzed in Section 5; (note that, for
χ = 0, f
M = M). The norms below refer to B(L2(Td)).
Lemma 6.2. Deﬁne f
M := M + δM with
δM = δM χ,λ := K(χ) −K(0),
where K(χ) = (M(z = 0, χ))λ2κ .
The operator δM is bounded, ∥δM χ,λ∥≤C, and relatively bounded w.r.t. to χ · ∇and M, with a bound of
order λ2. More precisely,
∥δMf∥≤λ2C(∥f∥+ ∥χ · ∇f∥) ,
(6.19)
for any function f in the domain of χ · ∇. Furthermore, (6.18) holds.
Proof. By inspection of the expressions for M in Section 6.2, we get
∥K(χ)f −K(0)f∥≤C
Z
dt |ψ(t)|
 min(|λ2tχ|, 1)∥f∥+ ∥f(· + λ2tχ) −f(·)∥

,
and (6.19) follows from the exponential decay of ψ(t). To prove (6.18) we verify that
λ−2(LS)λ2κ = iκ · ∇ε −χ · ∇+ O(λ2κ) ,
λ−2(M(z = 0, χ = 0))λ2κ = G + L + O(λ2κ) ,
by explicit computation. (The l-l and r-r terms in M give rise to L, the mixed ones to G.)
24

We conclude with the remark that, presumably, Lemma 6.2 cannot be improved to
lim
χ→0 ∥δM∥= 0 .
(6.20)
Such an estimate can easily be obtained for the l-r and r-l terms but not for l-l and r-r. To get a feeling for this,
let us consider a constant dispersion law, ε(k) = ε(0) (which would actually violate our assumptions, but this
should not matter here). Then Φk(t) = tε(0), and, by spectral calculus,
(Mll(0)p + Mrr(0)p)f(k) = −(2π)dλ2
Z ∞
−∞
dt ˆψ(t) f(k −λ2tχ) = −(2π)dλ2ψ(iχ · ∇)f(k) .
(6.21)
Obviously limχ→0 ∥ψ(iχ · ∇) −ψ(0)∥→0 holds only if the function ψ is constant.
6.4. Analysis of f
M. In this subsection, we show that, in a small open neighborhood of the origin, f
M has an
isolated simple eigenvalue λ2-close to that of M. We recall the deﬁnition of the gap gM(χ) (see Section 5) and
deﬁne Br to be the disk Br := {z ∈C : |z| ≤r}.
Lemma 6.3. There is a constant r > 0, r ∝gM(0), such that, inside the ball Br, M and f
M = M + δM
have unique simple eigenvalues uM ≡uM(κ, χ) and uf
M ≡uf
M(λ, κ, χ), respectively, with |uf
M −uM | = O(λ2).
Moreover, for z ∈Br,
1
z −f
M
=
1
z −uf
M
Pf
M + O(z0) .
Proof. For M, this has already been proven at κ = 0 in Section 5 and extended to κ ̸= 0 by using perturbation
theory of isolated eigenvalues (Section 5.4). Since δM is relatively bounded w.r.t. M, we can again use perturba-
tion theory to prove the claim for f
M. Estimating the resolvent (z −f
M)−1 by using a Neumann series expansion
in δM and applying (6.19), we obtain that
∥δM(z −M)−1∥≤λ2C
 1 + |z| + ∥(z −M)−1∥

,
(6.22)
which can be used to complete the proof of the lemma. (We refer the reader to [15] for details on the perturbation
theory for isolated eigenvalues.)
Although this will not be used in our analysis, it is worthwhile pointing out an important diﬀerence between
the spectral analysis of M and that of f
M: Thanks to the resolvent bound (5.3), we know that the spectrum
of M, apart from the eigenvalue u, is bounded away from the real axis. In the nomenclature of Section 5.4,
gM(κ, χ) > 0. In fact, by Lemma 5.2, item iv, we have an explicit bound, uniform in χ, on the real part of
eigenvalues with large imaginary part. For f
M, analogous statements do not hold, because δM is not small in
norm, but only relative to M; see (6.22). To guarantee that z /∈σ(f
M), the right-hand side of (6.22) should be
strictly smaller than one. Clearly, for any ﬁxed λ, this is not the case when Im z →±∞.
7. Analysis of R(z) around z = 0
In this section, we analytically continue the operator R(z) (see (6.11)), a priori only deﬁned for Re z > 0, to
the region {z ∈C : |z| < λ2r}, for some r > 0 and λ suﬃciently small. This is accomplished by applying
perturbation theory to the ﬁber operators (R(z))λ2κ. The guiding idea is that (R(z))λ2κ is a small perturbation
of (z −λ2M κ)−1, where M κ has been analyzed in Section 5. However, it turns out to be more convenient to
replace M by the operator f
M introduced in Section 6.3. In Section 7.1, we implement the perturbation theory
developed on the basis of Lemma 6.1. The small parameters are the coupling constant λ, the (scaled) ﬁber
momentum κ and the ﬁeld χ. All these three parameters must be assumed to be suﬃciently small throughout
our analysis, and we do not repeat this assumption in every step.
25

7.1. Perturbation around the kinetic limit.Recall the deﬁnition of R(z) in equation (6.11).
R(z) =
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt Z[0,t] .
The main results of this subsection state that the operator (R(z))λ2κ has a unique simple pole in a neighborhood
of z = 0, whose residue, P ≡P λ,κ,χ, is a rank-one operator (see Lemma 7.3) with the property that, in the ﬁber
indexed by κ = 0,
P λ,κ=0,χ = |ζ⟩⟨1| ,
with
∥ζ −ζM∥L2(Td) = O(λ2) ,
(7.1)
where ζM is the invariant state of the generator, M, of the linear Boltzmann evolution; see Section 5. This result
is stated in Lemma 7.5. Moreover, we show that P λ,κ,χ is an analytic function of κ and a regular function of
χ; see Lemma 7.4. On an intuitive level, this means that the long-time dynamics of (Z[0,t])λ2κ, is dominated by
the linear Boltzmann evolution etM. This statement is formalized in Section 8.1, for χ = 0, and in Section 8.2,
for χ ̸= 0.
To start with, we deﬁne an operator, S, acting on L2(Td) by
S ≡S(z, χ, λ, κ) := (LS + M(z) + Rex(z))λ2κ .
(7.2)
Note that (R(z))λ2κ = (z −S)−1 (whenever both sides are well-deﬁned), and that S(z) is a closed operator
on L2(Td). It is bounded except for the term χ · ∇that originates from LS.
For simplicity, we often abbreviate S(z, χ, λ, κ) by, for example, S(z), when we consider the operator-valued
function z 7→S(z), with the other variables kept ﬁxed. We use similar shorthand notation for uM ≡uM(λ, κ, χ),
P ≡P λ,κ,χ, etc. in this and the remaining sections.
Let D ⊂L2(Td) be the dense subspace of real-analytic functions on Td; cf. Section 5. Recall the constant kz
from Lemma 6.1.
Lemma 7.1.
i. D is a core for S and SD ⊂D. For all z ∈C satisfying Re z ≥−kz and such that (z −S(z))−1 exists (i.e.,
as a bounded operator), we have that (z −S(z))−1D ⊂D.
ii. The diﬀerences S(z) −S(z = 0) and S(κ) −S(κ = 0) are bounded operators, and they are analytic in the
variables κ, z in the region Rez > −kz and |κ| < kθ.
Proof. D is a core for S because it is a core for χ · ∇. Further, we ﬁrst establish that, for γ ∈Cd suﬃciently
small,
eγ·∇S e−γ·∇−S = O(γ) .
(7.3)
Note that for θ ∈C2d suﬃciently small, JθAJ−θ −A = O(θ), where A = LS + M(z) + Rex(z). This follows from
the analyticity of the dispersion law ε in LS and from Lemma 6.1 for M(z) + Rex(z). The bound (7.3) is then
obtained by restricting to a ﬁber. A Neumann series expansion of (z −S(z))−1, using (7.3), for some suﬃciently
small γ (depending on z), yields boundedness of eγ·∇(z −S(z))−1e−γ·∇. Together with (7.3), this implies part i,
after an application of the Paley-Wiener theorem.
To prove part ii, it suﬃces to observe that the term −χ · ∇in S is independent of z and κ.
Next, we argue that the condition z ∈σ(S(z)) has a unique solution z∗in a neighborhood of z = 0:
Lemma 7.2. Fix some r > 0 suﬃciently small, e.g., r = gM(0)/4. Then there is a unique z = z∗(λ, κ, χ) in Bλ2r
such that z −S(z) is not invertible, i.e., such that z ∈σ(S(z)). This unique z∗is an isolated simple eigenvalue
of S(z∗).
Proof. We write
S(z) = λ2 f
M + λ2(M(z) −M(0))λ2κ + (Rex(z))λ2κ =: λ2 f
M + A(z, λ) .
Recall that f
M has a unique, simple eigenvalue u f
M in Br, for some r > 0. Since
∥A(z, λ)∥≤C(λ4 + λ2|z|) ≤Cλ4 ,
26

for z ∈Bλ2r, an application of spectral perturbation theory shows that S(z) has a unique simple eigenvalue s(z)
in (to be concrete) the disk B3λ2r/4. This eigenvalue is given by
s(z) = λ2u f
M + Tr

P f
M A(z, λ)

+ O(∥A(z, λ)∥2) ,
(7.4)
where Pf
M is the spectral projection of f
M associated with the eigenvalue uf
M and the trace is over L2(Td).
Next, we show that there is a unique z ∈Br such that z ∈σ(S(z)). First, we show uniqueness of z: Assume
that there are two solutions z1, z2 of z ∈σ(S(z)). Then
|z1 −z2| = |s(z1) −s(z2)| ≤C|z1 −z2| sup
z∈Bλ2r

∂
∂z A(z, λ)
 ≤Cλ2|z1 −z2| ,
which is a contradiction, for λ small enough. From (7.4), we also get |s(z) −λ2u f
M | ≤C|λ|4.
Second, we show that there is at least one z ∈Br such that z ∈σ(S(z)): Assume there is no solution of
z ∈σ(S(z)). By taking κ suﬃciently small, we can make sure that u f
M lies in the ball Br/4. Then, denoting by
C the positively oriented integration contour
C := {z : |z| = λ2r/2} ,
(7.5)
we note that
sup
z∈C

1
z −λ2 f
M
 ≤Cλ−2,
sup
z∈C

1
z −S(z)
 ≤Cλ−2 .
The ﬁrst bound is stated in Lemma 6.3. The second bound follows from the ﬁrst one by Neumann series expansion,
using the bound on A(z, λ). Next, we note the identity
1
z −S(z) −
1
z −λ2 f

and integrate both sides along the contour C. The right-hand side is bounded in norm by C, thus, after integration,
it is bounded by Cλ2. On the left-hand side, the contour integral of
1
z−λ2 f
M yields the spectral projection P f
M .
We therefore arrive at a contradiction with the assumption that
1
z−S(z) has no singular points.
Lemma 7.3. The pole at z∗of z 7→(z −S(z))−1 is simple and its residue, P, is a rank-one operator.
Proof. Simplicity of the pole has already been established in the above proof. To get hold of the residue, we
expand S(z) in some neighborhood of z∗:
z −S(z) = z −z∗
| {z }
=:y
−(S(z∗) −z∗)
|
{z

|
{z

=:yF1
−S>1(z −z∗)

=:F2(y)
,
where S1(z∗) = ∂zS(z∗) and S>1(z −z∗) = P
n≥2
(z−z∗)n

(∂z)nS(z∗). First, we rewrite
1
y −F0 −yF1
=
1
y −(1 −F1)−1F0
·
1
1 −F1
.
(7.6)
From the considerations above, we know that F0 has an isolated simple eigenvalue at 0. It follows that 0 is also
an eigenvalue of (1 −F1)−1F0. Since F1 = O(λ2), ((1 −F1)−1 −1)F0 is a relatively bounded perturbation of F0
with small relative bound and hence perturbation theory ensures that this eigenvalue is again simple and isolated,
and we call PF the corresponding one-dimensional spectral projector. It follows that PF
1
1−F1 is the residue of
the function (7.6) at y = 0. Then, we write
1
y −F0 −yF1 −F2(y) =
1
1 + (y −F0 −yF1)−1F2(y) ·
1
y −F0 −yF1
.
(7.7)
Since ∥F2(y)∥≤C|y|2 and ∥(y −F0 −yF1)−1∥≤C|y|−1, the ﬁrst factor on the right side of (7.7) is analytic in
a neighborhood of y = 0 and it reduces to 1 at y = 0. It follows that the residue at y = 0 of the function (7.7) is
PF
1
1−F1 . Since PF is one-dimensional, this is a rank-one operator.
27

To continue, we denote the pole by u(λ, κ, χ) = z∗(λ, κ, χ).
In the statement of the next lemma, it is convenient to extend S to a function of γ deﬁned in a complex
neighborhood of γ = 0 by setting S(γ) := eγ·∇Se−γ·∇. As argued in the proof of Lemma 7.1, γ 7→S(γ) is
analytic, and the statements of the Lemmas 7.1 and 7.3 remain valid for suﬃciently small γ. We write
(R(z))λ2κ =
1
z −S(z) =
1
z −uP κ + Rκ(z) ,
(7.8)
with z 7→Rκ(z) bounded and analytic in Bλ2r, for some r > 0. In the following, we often use the shorthand
notations P ≡P κ and R(z) ≡Rκ(z).
Lemma 7.4. The pole u and the operators P κ, Rκ(z) are analytic in κ and γ.
Proof. Residue and pole can be expressed as contour integrals, namely
P =
1
2πi
Z
C
dz
1
z −S(z),
uP =
1
2πi
Z
C
dz
z
z −S(z) ,
(7.9)
where the contour C is deﬁned in (7.5). Then the analyticity in κ and γ follows from the analyticity of S(z), as
established in Lemma 7.1.
We now summarize our ﬁndings and derive some additional algebraic properties of the residue P.
Lemma 7.5. For κ = 0, the residue, P, can be written as P κ=0 = |ζλ,κ=0,χ⟩⟨1|, with ζ ≡ζλ,κ,χ ∈L2(Td) a
real-analytic function satisfying
∥ζ −ζM∥= O(λ2) ,
where ζM is the invariant state of M; see Section 5. For κ = 0, ζ is a probability density on Td. The function
u ≡u(λ, κ, χ) ∈C satisﬁes
u(κ) = u(−κ) ,
|u −λ2uM| = O(λ2) .
Moreover, we have that
u(κ = 0) = 0 ,
P κ=0Rκ=0(z) = 0 .
(7.10)
Proof. For an arbitrary exponentially localized density matrix ρS,
TrS[eiλ2κ·XZ[0,t]ρS] = TrS[(eiλ2κ·X)∗(Z[0,t]ρS)∗] = TrS[e−iλ2κ·XZ[0,t]ρS] ,
where we have used that Z[0,t] preserves positivity, in particular, hermiticity. Writing this in terms of ﬁbers,
taking the Laplace transforms and comparing the singular parts, we get u(−¯κ) = u(κ). For real z, the operator
R(z) =
R
dt e−tzZt preserves positivity, hence R(z)ρS ≥0, for an arbitrary positive-deﬁnite ρS, which implies
the positivity of the function P 0(ρS)0, where 0 refers to the zero ﬁber. Writing P κ = |ζκ⟩⟨˜ζκ|, it then follows
that ζ0 can be chosen to be positive. Since Z[0,t] preserves the trace, it follows that TrS [R(z)ρS] = 1/z. Hence,
from (7.8) (evaluated in the ﬁber indexed by κ = 0),
1
z =
1
z −u(κ = 0)⟨1, P 0(ρS)0⟩+ ⟨1, R0(z) (ρS)0⟩= 1
z ⟨1, ζ0⟩⟨˜ζ0, (ρS)0⟩+ ⟨1, R0(z) (ρS)0⟩.
Since this identity has to hold for any density matrix ρS, and because R0(z) is an analytic function, we conclude
that u(κ = 0) = 0, P 0R0(z) = 0 and ˜ζ0 = c1. Choosing the normalization c = 1, it follows that
R
Td ζ0 = 1,
i.e., ζ0 is a probability density. The analyticity of γ 7→eγ·∇Pe−γ·∇implies boundedness of eγ·∇ζκ, eγ·∇˜ζκ, and
hence analyticity of k 7→ζκ(k), ˜ζκ(k). The bounds by terms O(λ2) follow immediately from the perturbation
theory outlined above.

8. Proof of main results
Before we prove our main results for χ ̸= 0, we ﬁrst address the equilibrium regime, χ = 0.
8.1. The equilibrium regime.If the ﬁeld χ vanishes, our results can be strengthened, because δM = 0. For
χ = 0, the function z 7→(R(z))λ2κ has only one pole, u(λ, κ, χ = 0), in the region Re z > −λ2gM(κ, χ = 0)+O(λ4);
(cf. the remark following Lemma 6.3). Then the pole u(λ, κ, χ = 0) determines the long-time properties of the
dynamics. By applying an inverse Laplace transform, one then easily proves the following theorem.
Theorem 8.1. [Equilibrium asymptotics] We set χ = 0. Then, for 0 < λ and κ suﬃciently small, there is a
constant g > 0 such that
(Z[0,t])λ2κ −eu(κ)tP κ = O
 e−gλ2t
,
as t →∞,
as operators on L2(Td).
Note that g can be chosen as g = gM(0)/5, for example. Also recall that u(κ = 0) = 0, by Lemma 7.5. For
the proof, we refer to Theorem 4.5 of [20].
8.2. Proof of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3.
Proof of Theorem 3.2. We ﬁrst set χ = 0. Let f be a continuous function on Td, (hence
Mf ∈Ati). Then
Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 8.1 yield
TrS[MfZ[0,t]ρS] = ⟨f, ζ0⟩+ O(e−gλ2t) ,
as
t →∞,
proving (3.12).
To prove (3.11), we choose χ ̸= 0 and deﬁne X := B(L2(Td)). Then the function t 7→Z[0,t] is in L∞(R+, X).
A standard Tauberian theorem, see e.g. [17] or [13], states the equivalence of
lim
T →∞
1
T
Z T
0
dt (Z[0,t])0 = x ,
and
lim
z→0, Re z≥0 z
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt(Z[0,t])0 = x ,
for some x ∈X. Existence of the ﬁrst limit yields Theorem 3.2. We show that the second limit exists: By
Equation (7.8) we have that, for |z| suﬃciently small,
z
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt(Z[0,t])0 =
z
z −u(κ = 0)P 0 + zR0(z) .
(8.1)
Since u(0) = 0 and z 7→R0(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of z = 0, the limit equals P 0.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. We start from the identity
⟨X(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β =
Z t
0
ds ⟨V (s)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β + ⟨X⟩ρS⊗ρR,β ,
which follows from the deﬁnition of the velocity operator (4.10) in ﬁnite-volume and can be easily justiﬁed, using
Lemma 3.1, in the thermodynamic limit, for exponentially localized density matrices ρS; see Section 5.2 of [6] for
details. Hence
1
t ⟨X(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β = 1
t
Z t
0
ds ⟨V (s)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β + 1
t ⟨X(0)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β
= ⟨∇ε, ζχ,λ⟩+ O(t−1) ,
(8.2)
as t →∞. Since ρS is exponentially localized, the second term on the right-hand side of the last line vanishes
as t →∞, and we conclude that v(χ) = ⟨∇ε, ζχ,λ⟩. The statement that v(χ) ̸= 0, for 0 < |χ| suﬃciently small,
follows from vM(χ) ̸= 0, for λ small enough.
29

We deﬁne the diﬀusion tensor D ≡D(χ) by
Dij := −λ−4
∂2
∂κiκj

κ=0
u(κ) ,
(8.3)
where the factor λ−4 is attributed to the fact that the ﬁber momentum is λ2κ, rather than κ. From u(κ) = u(−κ),
we conclude that D has real entries. For χ ̸= 0 suﬃciently small, positive-deﬁniteness follows from the fact
that u(k) is a C∞function in χ (see Lemma 6.1 in [6]), and the positive-deﬁniteness of D(χ = 0). It remains to
argue that the above deﬁnition in terms of the eigenvalue u is equivalent to the one given in (3.13), namely,
Dij = lim
T →∞
1
T 2
Z ∞
0
dt e−t
T ⟨(Xi(t) −vi(χ)t)(Xj(t) −vj(χ)t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β .
This is straightforward, and we omit details. But we do explain an analogous argument relating the expression
for the asymptotic velocity v(χ) in terms of the eigenvalue to the one involving moments of X; i.e., we check that
v(χ) = ⟨∇ε, ζχ,λ⟩= i ∂
∂κ

κ=0
u(κ) .
(8.4)
It follows from our discussion in Section 4.1 that
TrS[XρS,t] = i ∂
∂κ

κ=0
⟨1, (ρS,t)λ2κ⟩,
and we obtain, using TrS[XρS,t] = O(t), that
z2

dt e−zt TrS [XρS,t] = z2i
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt ∂

κ=0
⟨1, (ρS,t)λ2κ⟩
= z2i ∂
∂κ

κ=0
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt⟨1, (ρS,t)λ2κ⟩,
for Re z > 0. By straightforward manipulations, using (8.2), the limit z →0 of the left-hand side equals v(χ).
We abbreviate
∂
∂κ

κ=0f(κ) by f ′(0). Thanks to Lemma 7.5, it follows that
z2
Z ∞
0
dt e−zt TrS [XρS,t] = iz2⟨1,
1
z −u(0)P 0(ρS)0⟩′ + iz2⟨1, R0(z) (ρS))0⟩′
=
iz2u′(0)
(z −u(0))2 ⟨1, P 0(ρS)0⟩+
iz2
z −u(0)⟨1, P 0(ρS)0⟩′ + O(z2)
= iu′(0) + O(z) ,
as z →0, where we have used that P κ, Rκ(z) are analytic in z, κ and that u(0) = 0, ⟨1, P 0(ρS)0⟩= 1. Passing
to the limit z →0, we conﬁrm (8.4).
Note that, with our present methods, we cannot prove the existence of the limit
lim
T →∞
1
T
Z T
0
dt 1
t ⟨(Xi(t) −vi(χ)t)(Xj(t) −vj(χ)t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β.
The problem is that Tauberian theorems only hold if one can bound the integrand by a constant, whereas we
only have a rough a priori bound, namely ⟨X2(t)⟩ρS⊗ρR,β ≤C|t|2. When χ ̸= 0 we therefore have to state our
results in terms of Laplace transforms of time-dependent quantities in t.
