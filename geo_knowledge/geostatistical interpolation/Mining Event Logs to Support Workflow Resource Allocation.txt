Abstract: Currently, workflow technology is widely used to facilitate the working process in enterprise information 
systems (EIS), and it has the potential to reduce design time, enhance product quality and decrease product cost. However, 
significant limitations still exist: as an important task in the context of workflow, many present resource allocation 
operations are still performed manually, which are time-consuming. This paper presents a data mining approach to address 
the resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow resource management. Specifically, an 
Apriori-like algorithm is used to find the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated 
according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a correlation measure named lift is utilized to 
annotate the negatively correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the rules are ranked using the 
confidence measures as resource allocation rules. Comparative experiments are performed using C4.5, SVM, ID3, Naïve 
Bayes and the presented approach, and the results show that the presented approach is effective in both accuracy and 
candidate resource recommendations. 
 
Keywords: workflow, resource allocation, data mining, process mining, association rules. 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Workflow is now an embedded technology in many 
enterprise information systems (EIS, e.g. PLM, ERP, 
CRM, SCM and B2B applications etc.). Workflow 
resource allocation serves as an indispensable link 
between workflow activities and resources, and it directly 
determines the execution quality of the workflow activities 
[1-3].  
Based on our investigation, most of the resource 
allocation tasks in present workflow management systems 
are usually performed using a role-based approach [2, 4, 
5]. That is, to divide the workflow resources (actors) into 
different candidate groups based on their role and the 
organization properties. Once the workflow cases are 
originated, the workflow engine assigns the works to 
proper resource groups [4, 6]. Such resource allocation is 
somewhat coarse-grained and may fail in some situations. 
For example, in the manufacturing enterprises, a 
manufacturing process sheet work might be predefined to 
be undertaken by the resources with the role “process 
planning designer”. Actually, some of the processes 
planning works have to be further assigned to a smaller 
group of one or more qualified designers instead of all the 
process planning designers. Thus, the present resource 
allocation 
methods 
may 
make inappropriate 
staff 
assignments and the final quality of the products may 
suffer from it. Therefore, in some industries such as the 
manufacturing enterprises, most of run-time workflow 
resource allocation works are still performed manually by 
the administrators. The number of administrators is 
usually small, whereas the activities are of great 
abundance in some cases. That makes it a time-consuming 
work to allocate the workflow resources manually.  
Fortunately 
enough, 
contemporary 
workflow 
applications usually record the business events in event 
logs. These logs typically contain information about 

- 2 - 
 
events referring to a case, an activity, and an originator 
[7-10]. The case (also referred to as process instance) is a 
work that is being handled, e.g. a process planning sheet 
design, a compressor design, an NC programming, etc. As 
the atomic element of the case, an activity is an instance of 
a workflow task. An originator is a resource (usually a 
person) that executes the activity[6]. In this paper, a 
Process refers to a workflow template of the case, a Task 
represents a series of similar activities, and a Resource 
refers to a task performer.  
This paper presents an Apriori-like algorithm [11, 12] 
to find frequent patterns from the workflow logs, which 
are used to generate rules according to a “resource 
allocation rule constraint”. All the negative correlated 
rules are annotated with a rule evaluation measure referred 
to as “correlation measures”. Then, the selected rules are 
ranked in a descending sequence by their confidence, and 
the final rules are then recommended to workflow 
administrators at workflow run-time. 
The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 
First, it designs a closed-loop workflow framework for a 
more intelligent and finer-grained resource management. 
Second, it proposes an association rule mining approach to 
find the logics between workflow resources and the 
activities, which would help decision-making in resource 
allocation.  
The remainder of this paper is presented as follows: In 
Section 2, we design a closed-loop workflow architecture 
for optimizing resource allocation. Later on, we study the 
workflow event models and their relationships in Section 
3, and then propose our mining approach in Section 4. In 
Section 5, we empirically compare some classification 
algorithms (C4.5, SVM, ID3, and Naïve Bayes) with our 
approach. In Section 6, we discuss some possible 
improvements. Finally, we discuss the related works in 
workflow resource allocation in Section 7, and conclude 
this paper in Section 8. 
 
2. 
A closed-loop workflow framework for resource 
allocation 
Our work is based on a National Defense Project 
named Agile Process Preparation System (APPS) for a 
large radar-manufacturing corporation [13] in Nanjing, 
Jiangsu, China. APPS is a process-aware information 
system, and it applies a workflow module to manage the 
works of CAX units (e.g. CAD, CAM, CAPP, etc.). This 
workflow 
module 
manages 
the 
resources 
(performers/actors) using a closed-loop approach. The 
framework of the approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 Overview of the approach 
The 
closed-loop 
workflow 
resource 
allocation 
approach mainly includes three steps: 
Step 1: The execution history of the workflow 
activities is recorded in a transaction log referred to as 
workflow log. 
Step 2: The system utilizes an Apriori-like association 
rule mining algorithm to extract the resource allocation 
knowledge from the workflow log. 
Step 3: Once a new workflow activity is originated, the 
system automatically recommends the administrator with 
a default resource and other proper candidates according 
to 
the 
mined 
association 
rules. 
The 
workflow 
administrator may simply approve the default assignment 
or choose another resource in the candidate list for the 
work considering the reality.  
 
3. 
From workflow log to Resource Allocation 
Rules 

- 3 - 
 
Our goal is to distill resource allocation rules with high 
prediction accuracy out of the workflow event log. A 
workflow event typically includes three primary kinds of 
information: the workflow process information, the 
workflow task information and the resource information. 
The association rule involving these three dimensions 
without repeated predicates falls in the multi-dimensional 
association rules mining domain[14].

This process is modeled in a Petri-net-like model 
referred to as WF-NET. Entities in this diagram are: 
process, task, and routing, etc [4, 15]. First, in Task A, the 
system automatically searches the database for similar 
cases. If there are cases meeting the requirements, the 
process would be submitted to Task D, and the designer 
will download the case documents and alter them. If there 
is no well-suited case, the work would be passed through a 
parallel routing to both Task B and Task C, and new 
design tasks will be assigned to corresponding designers 
for Task B and co-designer for Task C. When both the 
Task B and C are finished, the designed document will be 
archived in Task E and the whole design process ends. 
Note that, we do not consider iteration routings, like the 
directed line from place 
6P  to Task A. 
A workflow log generates as the works transact from 
one step to another consistent with the control flow of the 
process in Fig. 2. Note that we filter out some notions such 
as time stamps, event types, which are not helpful here. 

- 4 - 
 
Neither do we consider the ordering of the events 
corresponding to different cases.  
We consider workflow logs as a sequence of distinct 
workflow activities, where subsequences, such as the 
cases (a case is an instance of a process.), can be observed 
by usually long gaps between consecutive queries. For 
example, as is shown in Table 1, assume that a workflow 
log consists the following workflow transaction events:

divided into activity set view according to process id and

each Activity corresponds to a same pair of process and 
task. Thus, we get a schematic view of the sample of the 
workflow log in Table 2:

For convenience, we define some models used in the 
mining process by adopting some notions defined in Ref.

The task and process entities fall in the control flow

like 
the

we do not take into account such information in this paper. 
 
3.1.2. 
Workflow log 
To handle cases is the primary objective of a workflow 
system, where the tasks of similar cases are organized in 
the same ways, namely workflow processes. In other 
words, a case is an instance of some process. The 
transaction events generate as the cases run in the 
workflow system. A workflow log is a collection of 
transaction events of the task executions. Workflow log 
records the information such that: (1) each event refers to 
an activity, which is a task in the process, (2) each event 
refers to a case, which is an instance of process, (3) each 
event refers to a performer, a workflow resource (probably 
a staff, or just a printer) executing the activity. Therefore, 
we abstract the event log as a set of quadruples: 
(
,
,
,
)
case task resource timestamp  
The tuple indicates that a resource executes the task of 
an instance of process at a specific time. In this paper, we 
focus on who execute what task in which process and do 
not care much about the execution time and the sequence 
of the tasks (cases). What interests us is thus the 
co-occurrence of processes, tasks, and resources. As a case 
is an instance of a process, we can easily get the process

identities with case identities. Let’s denote the sets

to be the sets of K processes, M tasks and N resources in

information and get the process information from the 
cases), we can translate each quadruple to a triple of 
(

process task resource .  
Consider a sample of the workflow transaction log in 
our workflow management system shown in Table 1. 
Typically, the log contains thousands of records, where 
each record refers to a certain workflow activity. An 
activity is an execution composed of a process, a task, and 
a resource, probably a staff.

HasOrgEntity, HasRoleEntity), 
Where Process, Task, Resource are three dimension 
tables. These tables are linked to the Workflow_log table 
via three keys: ProcessID, TaskID and ResourceID. The 
correlated star schema of our warehouse is depicted in Fig. 
3. 
The log for mining must meet the requirements 
brought forth in [15] before process mining. The log data 
is preprocessed to get qualified for process mining, these 
pre-processing include revising or eliminating the faulty or 
unsound data. Faulty or unsound data mainly refer to those 
incomplete data, which are short of the necessary data 
items such as the activity, process, case or originator. 
Therefore, before mining, some preparations are necessary. 
First, if the log data comes from different data sources, 
then corresponding translation is essential for a unified 
data format and easier to process in the following steps, 
these works are some data processing methods such as 
coding, simplification, etc. 
In the workflow log in Table 1, the EventID, the ActID 
and the CaseID are the # of the workflow events, the 
workflow activities and the workflow process cases, 
respectively. The Resource is the name of the originators. 
The log segment includes 33 events, involves 5 activities, 
5 resources, 4 cases and a process 
66
p .  
In this paper, the attributes in the workflow log are all 
nominal. Instead of searching on only one attribute like 
process, we need to run through multidimensional 
attributes including process, task and resource, treating 
each attribute-value pair as an itemset. We use the 
multidimensional data shown in the star schema in Fig. 3 
to construct a data cube [17-19]. The generalization of 
group by, roll-up and cross-tab ideas is to aggregate the 
dimensions. In Fig. 3, it is a 3-dimensional data cube, and 
the traditional GROUP BY generates the 3-dimensional 
data cube core. The lower-dimensional aggregates appear 
as points, lines, planes, or cubes hanging off the data cube 
core.

lattice of cuboids defining a data cube for the dimensions

form like LHS


, that is, from Left Hand Side 
(LHS) to Right Hand Side (RHS). By using the data cube, 
we may get several different multidimensional rules.

that the task

Definition 3. (Resource Allocation Rule Constraint) 
For an activity of Task Y in Process X, and the 
Resource Z, our research objective in this paper is to find 
the resource allocation rule as follows called PTR (process,

can get a list of the rules by iterating this step to all of the 
frequent itemsets in the event log. “Find the execution of 
what task may promote the working frequency of the 
resources in the same case (the instance of a process)” is 
an association rules mining query, which can be expressed 
in a data mining query language (DMQL) as follows: 
 
Mine multi-dimensional association rules as 
Process+(A, A.ProcessName) and  
Task+(B, B.TaskName, ?[C], _, _)  Resource+(C, 
C.ResourceName, ?[D], ?[E])

and

This mining query allow the generation of association 
rules in the form as below: 
 
Process (9, “Process Planning File Design”) and Task 
(1, “Search for similar file”, 9, “others”, “Search for 
similar file template in the file database.”) 
 
Resource(3, 
Tom, 
“1,2,5”, 
“2,6,7,9”) 
[conf:(0.59); 
sup:(0.032); lift:(5)] 
 
The rules mean that if a work activity of the Task 1 in 
Process 9 is to be executed, there is a 59% probability that 
the work will be performed by Resource 3, Tom. A further 
indication of the rule is that, 3.2% of all the workflow 
events fulfilled all the criteria, and the lift measure of this 
rule is 5, indicating it a positively correlated association 
rule.

approach to mine resource allocation rules 
We have introduced some basic terms in resource 
allocation rules mining in previous subsections. In order to 
mine the multidimensional association rules from the 
event logs, in this subsection, we present a three-stage 
approach to get the useful rules. 
Stage 1. Generated raw resource allocation rules: Find 
all frequent 3-itemsets, and generate resource allocation 
rules using the rule constraint in Definition 3, and by 
definition, each of the itemsets should satisfy the 
minimum support and minimum confidence. 
Stage 2. Annotate the rules by Negative Correlation 
Annotation algorithm. 
Stage 3. Make a rule sequence by confidence of the 
rules using resource allocation rules sorting method. 
 
4.1. 
Frequent resource allocation rules generation  
In association rules mining domain, an itemset I is 
frequent only if its support value satisfies the minimum 
support threshold min_sup. The term support here is also 
referred to as relative support, and it indicates the 
occurrence frequency of the itemset[14]. For association 
rules mining in the form of p
t
r

, we define the term 
support as:                                                                                                     
( , , )
sup(
)
( )
count p t r
p
t
r
count L


  
 
 
 
(2) 
As is shown in Eq.(2), the support measure is the 
percentage of transactions in L  that contain the itemset 
( , , )
p t r , The function 
( )
count L  returns the number of 
records in the log, and the 
( , , )
count p t s  returns the 
count of event logs corresponding to the process p , task 
t  and resource r .  
Frequent itemset mining leads to the discovery of 
associations and correlations among items in large 
transactional data sets. However, this can be a 
time-consuming procedure. In this paper, we use the 
Apriori algorithm to find frequent patterns. Apriori is a 
classical algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant 
in 1994 for mining association rules, and is proved to be 
efficient and scalable for both artificial and real world data 
sets[11, 12]. The high performance of this algorithm is 
based on the priori knowledge that all nonempty subsets of 
a frequent itemset must also be frequent, and here we use 
its contraposition. 
We apply the Apriori algorithm along with the 
“Resource Allocation Constraint”. According to Definition 
3, the frequent itemset should be 3-dimentional, and the 
frequent itemsets must satisfy min_sup threshold. We can 
get the mining algorithm below:

Once that the frequent 3-itemsets from the log have 
been found, it is straightforward to generate strong rules 
from them. Strong rules are those who both satisfy 
minimum support threshold (min_sup) and minimum 
confidence threshold (min_conf) . The rule p
t
r

 has 
confidence c in the transactions log set L, where c is the 
percentage of transactions in L containing p
t
 that also 
contain r . It is a conditional probability:

To convert the frequent itemsets into strong resource 
allocation rules, we use the constraint in Definition 3 to 
confine the dimension and form of the mined rules, and 
we may get a list of these “qualified in form” rules below: 
 
Rule 1: 
process=8 task=1 655 ==> resource=19 655    conf:(1) 
Rule 2: 
process=7 task=1 206 ==> resource=17 199    conf:(0.97) 
Rule 3: 
process=5 
task=8 
296 
==> 
resource=4 
 
276    
conf:(0.93) 
 
4.2. 
Negatively correlated rules annotation 
In the previous sections, we discussed the method of 
finding the frequent executors for the workflow tasks. 
However, the rules mined with the support-confidence 
framework discussed above may disclose some not so 
interesting event relationships[21, 22]. Let us examine the 
attached rules:  
Rule 1: ProcessID=1 TaskID=2 ==> ResourceID=4   conf:(0.59) 
[support_count=967]  
Rule 2: ProcessID=1 TaskID=2 ==> ResourceID=17  conf:(0.20) 
[support_count=328]  
Rule 3: ProcessID=1 TaskID=2 ==> ResourceID=13  conf:(0.13) 
[support_count=213]  
As illustrated in the list, all of the rules are above the 
support/confidence threshold. However, Rule 2 would be 
misleading when

Therefore, by definition, LHS(

actually negatively correlated as the existence of LHS 
actually decreases the likelihood of RHS.

The negatively correlation annotation indicates that, 
although it is appropriate to assign the annotated resources 
to the workflow activity, it is better to keep them in 
reserve for their primary works.  
The negatively-correlated-rule-annotation algorithm is 
as follows:

Rules 
confidence 
ranking: 
sort 
rules 
by 
confidence 
In association rule mining area, a major method to sort 
a collection of association rules is the most-confident 
selection method[24, 25]. The most-confident rule 
selection method always chooses the highest confidence 
among all the association rules whose support value is 
above the min_sup threshold. Hence, we use the 
confidence measure to sort the resulting rules to generate 
the resource allocation rules list for decision support. 
When the PTR rules are generated, the rules are then 
divided into different sets by their LHS. Suppose that for a 
specific rule set with the LHS (
3
6
p
t

), the mined strong 
PTR rules are: 
 
Rule 1: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=7      conf:(0.26) 
[support_count=426]  
Rule 2: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=11     conf:(0.54) 
[support_count=885]  
Rule 3: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=13     conf:(0.10) 
[support_count=164]  
 

- 10 - 
 
In this example, the confidence values of Rule 1, Rule 
2, and Rule 3 are 0.26, 0.54 and 0.10, respectively. Then 
we get the ranked rule list by the confidence measure in 
descendant order:  
 
Rule 2: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=11     conf:(0.54) 
[support_count=885]  
Rule 1: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=7      conf:(0.26) 
[support_count=426]  
Rule 3: ProcessID=3 TaskID=6 ==> ResourceID=13     conf:(0.10) 
[support_count=164]  
 
With most-confident selection method, the system then 
automatically chooses the resource 
11
r  from rule 2 as 
default recommendation for the administrator. Note that in 
our approach, the system will also recommend the 
resources suggested by rest of the list, 
7r  and 
13
r  (from 
Rule 1 and Rule 3) as alternatives. For N different test 
cases, let C be the number of correct predictions, then the 
resource prediction accuracy of the activity (
3
6
p
t

) is: 
C
precision
N

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
The rationale of most-confident selection method is 
that the testing data will share the same characteristics as 
the training data [25, 26]. Thus, if a rule has a high 
confidence in the training data, then this rule would also 
show a high accuracy in the testing data.

from the KM PDM database using SQL queries. Given the 
workflow log data, the first step is to clean the raw data. 
We filter out noise logs with no originators and those logs 
performed automatically or allocated to originators at 
design-time (The existence of these event logs will not 
help us in mining the run-time resource allocation rules). 
Finally, we get a log with 75934 items.

Training Data overview 
Table 3 shows the execution frequency counts of the 
training log, each column of the table shows the task 
sequence number in the process, and each row 
corresponds to a process. As we can see, the columns of 
the table are the processes, and the rows represent the # of 
the tasks in processes, and the numbers in the cells are the 
frequency counts of the corresponding process and task. 
There are 10 processes and 141 tasks in the training 
dataset.

Parameters selection 
The measure min_sup has a strong effect on the quality 
of the rules mined. On one hand, if min_sup is set too high, 
those possible rules that cannot satisfy the min_sup 
threshold but with high confidence may be excluded, and 
this directly affect the prediction accuracy of the rules. On 
the other hand, when min_sup is set too low, the mining 
process will be time-consuming [24, 25, 27]. Therefore, 
for the support value, we have to balance efficiency 
against quality. From our experiments, we observe that for 
our training set, once min_sup is lowered to 0.001%, the 
rules mined are more accurate than the classifier built by 
C4.5.

From Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we can see that when min_sup 
threshold is lowered to 0.001%, the overall accuracy of the

rules will go to the upper limit, 61.453%. Therefore, in 
this paper, we set min_sup=0.001%. We also set a limit of 
20,000 on the total number of candidate rules in memory 
(including those dropped-off rules that do not satisfy either 
min_sup or min_conf).

Thus we can get a subset of most confident resource

activity. We make some comparison experiments between 
this Apriori-based classifier and the classification 
algorithms in [2, 28] using the data mining tool 
WEKA[29]. For the Apriori-based classifier[25], we set 
the parameters as: min_conf=0.05, min_sup=0.0001%, 
and rules number upper limit=10000; the others are four 
classification algorithms applied in Refs. [2, 28]: SVM, 
C4.5, 
ID3 
and 
Naïve 
Bayes, 
considering 
the 
characteristics and variation of the training dataset, we set 
the test mode as 10-fold cross-validation. 
Table 4 lists the number of correct predictions, mining 
time, and overall prediction accuracy of the algorithms.

From Table 4, we conclude that except Naïve Bayes, 
other algorithms achieve an overall accuracy about 60%, 
and the values are very close. Naïve Bayes performs best 
in mining time, and the training/testing time of SVM is 
extremely long.  
The performance of the proposed classifier based on 
the most confident selection method is reasonable 
compared with those in [2, 28]. However, the overall 
prediction accuracy of around 60% also implies that about 
40% of all the system-assigned workflow activities need 
manual reassignments. Therefore, the rules with highest 
accuracy to the testing data are not always the best choice. 
Take

 for example, Rule 1 is of a 
confidence 51%, and the sum of top 3 positively 
correlated rules reaches up to 80.63%.  
Therefore, instead of suggesting one best prediction 
for each class of workflow activities, the system also 
recommend other strong resource allocation rules to the 
workflow administrators as candidates: when the 
resources with high confidence are unavailable at the 
moment, the remaining 
candidates (including the 
annotated resources) in the list could be the alternatives. 
In addition, with the assistance of the negatively 
correlated rules annotations, the administrators can 
have a holistic view of the resources’ work priorities. 
They can make assignments following the positively 
correlated rules in priority, and turn to negatively 
correlated ones only when all the prior resources are 
heavily occupied.  
 
5.5. 
Special events and further discussion 
Note that in Fig. 10, there are weak-predicated cases 
like the activity #71 (12.9%), #83 (28.4%) and #140 
(26.4%) etc., in fact, these activities have some common 
features. Through further analysis, we find the reasons as 
follows: firstly, the task is probably of relatively small 
number of training samples, like #71 and #140 (refer to 

- 14 - 
 
Fig. 5), the inadequacy of training samples leads to a weak 
prediction. Another reason is, each work has been evenly 
assigned to many resources (like the activity #83, usually 
with more than 5 actors), therefore, there is actually no 
strict No. 1 actor for these activities and it usually does not 
matter which resource to reform the task. 
In the proposed approach, the rules of different forms 
from the PTR rules are eliminated from the resource 
allocation recommendation list. However, we find some of 
these intermediate products of interestingness. Following 
are two examples: 
Let us see a strong RP rule (resource to process): 
17
3,
0.73
r
p
conf


, this rule implies that 73% of the 
work of resource 
17
r  locates in process 
3
p , so we may 
infer that resource 
17
r  is skilled in the tasks in 
3
p . 
Besides, 
the 
TP 
rule 
(task 
to 
process) 
16
2 ,
0.49
t
p
conf


 indicates that about half of the 
tasks 
16
t
 are in process 
2
p , which just conforms with 
the statistic results in Table 3. 
These “by-products” have no distinct contribution to 
workflow resource allocation, but still of reference values 
to the workflow administrators.

Related work 
The workflow technology provides a broad support to 
manage the works running in information systems. Such 
generic information systems that are configured on the 
basis of process models are referred to as process-aware 
information systems (PAISs, e.g., workflow management 
systems, ERP systems, CRM systems, PDM systems), and 
are now widely used in manufacturing enterprises.  
Nowadays, a hot topic in the workflow context is to 
find and use the knowledge in the workflow management 
procedures[30-34]. Current PAISs usually record all kinds 
of events, the omnipresence of event logs in PAISs is a 
motivator of process mining. Process mining is a 
state-of-art technology in discovering useful information 
(e.g., knowledge of process control flow or organizational 
structures) from event logs [15, 35]. For different mining 
perspectives, the result varies: the control flow mining is 
in the process perspective; and so are the organizational 
architecture and relationships of the workflow systems. 
As far as we know, despite of the great efforts spent on 
the control flow and data aspect of workflow, the 
organizational aspect of processes have been often 
neglected. To date, there has been a relatively small body 
of researches in workflow resource allocation. However, 
in order to fully understand workflow, it is very important 
to find the relationship between the processes and the 
resources[2], e.g. by whom the activities should be 
performed.  
The target of the allocation of the workflow tasks to 
resource is to find the logic between the workflow process, 
the activity, and the resources. In the organizational aspect 
of process mining, according to [15, 35], there are four 
measures: measures based on (possible) causality, 
measures based on joint cases, measures based on joint 
activities, measures based on special event types. To the 
best of our knowledge, related researches so far have 
made classification as a popular choice to discover 
resource allocation knowledge from the workflow logs, 
and most of the recent research activities in resource 
allocation fall into process mining[9] in the organizational 
perspective, namely organizational mining, related work is 
as follows: 
Ref. [2] discussed an approach to semi-automating the 
run-time staff assignment in workflow management 
systems. In order to reduce the amount of manual staff 
assignments, Y. Liu et al. apply the machine learning 
technology to the workflow event log from three 
enterprises to learn the kinds of activities that each staff 
undertakes. In Ref. [1], Ly et al. shows that the task of 
mining staff assignment rules using history data and 
organizational information can be considered as a 
inductive learning problem, and they adapt a decision 
learning approach to derive staff assignment rules.  
In Ref. [28], Rinderle and van der Aalst develop a 
framework for the complete life-cycle support for staff 

- 15 - 
 
assignment rules. Ref. [36] uses Hidden Markov Models 
to allocate the proficient staffs for a whole business 
process based on the workflow event log. In Ref. [37], 
Andrzejak et al. present a closed-loop workflow 
framework in control flow aspect, that implements a 
general closed control loop of planning – execution – 
result validation – re-planning, and generates workflows. 
In our previous work in Refs.[38], we present a 
closed-loop workflow management framework: we apply 
a statistic approach to derive resource allocation 
knowledge from the workflow log to assist assigning the 
resources for the upcoming workflow tasks. The mined 
staff assignment information is then feedback to construct 
a closed-loop in workflow resource management. 
As is shown in the previous works mentioned above, 
researchers concentrate on finding the suggestion with the 
highest accuracy for a class of workflow activities. 
However, these best suggestions may not always be the 
best choices, sometimes the best prediction comes from 
the administrator’s judgments, according to the real-time 
situation of the system. Our approach is different from that 
of Refs. [1, 2, 28, 36] in that we not only give the best 
prediction 
for 
each 
activity, 
but 
also 
give 
a 
recommendation of candidate predictions. Such strategy 
makes it an easier way for the administrators to reach for 
applicable alternatives when the default prediction fails. 
The idea of automatic resource allocation can also be 
found in the literature on advanced manufacturing 
technologies, typically, the Advanced Planning and 
Scheduling (APS)[39]. APS refers to a manufacturing 
process management (MPM) by which the production 
resources (including materials and production capacity) 
are optimally allocated to meet the manufacturing 
demands. In Ref. [40], Stadtler discusses the essence of 
SCM and advanced planning in the form of two 
conceptual frameworks: The house of SCM and the supply 
chain planning matrix. In Ref. [39], Lee et al. present a 
model for advanced planning and scheduling (APS) that 
requires an absolute due date with outsourcing in a 
manufacturing supply chain. The proposed model 
considers alternative process plans for job types, with 
precedence constraints for job operations. Another 
research about advanced resource planning is proposed by 
Vandaele et al.[41, 42]. They propose a decision support 
module for the manufacturing planning and control system 
called advanced resource planning (ARP). The ARP 
module provides a parameter-setting process, with the 
ultimate goal of yielding realistic information about 
production lead times for scheduling purposes, sales and 
marketing, strategic and operational decision making, and 
suppliers and customers.

Conclusions and future work 
We have presented a decision-making approach using 
data mining technology to make recommendations to 
workflow initiators. In the closed-loop workflow resource 
allocation framework, the association rules mining 
algorithms are applied to the workflow event log for 
mining resource allocation rules. Our current research is 
oriented towards developing more productive WfMS in 
resource management along the following lines: (a) 
implementing the proposed framework in a web-based 
architecture, (b) association rules mining to generate 
strong resource allocation rules, (c) using the negative 
correlation measures to annotate the negative correlated 
rules, (d) ranking the rules to make decision support for 
resource allocation.  
To illustrate, we make some comparison experiments 
on the log data distract from a manufacturing enterprise, 
experiment results show an overall accuracy of over 50%, 
and we made a comparison between the presented 
approach and the classification algorithms and analyzed 
their performances. Feasibility evaluation via a case study 
suggests that the proposed approach would be useful in 
supporting workflow resource allocation. 
Then we discuss the advantages and limitations of the 
method. Along with the administrators’ awareness of the 
workload of the resources, and professional knowledge to 
different product design tasks, our approach can well 
handle most of the resource allocation problems in PAISs.  

- 16 - 
 
Our future work includes two main parts: (1) compare 
some other machine learning approaches like inductive 
learning programming (ILP) with our present method to 
find some more efficient and effective approaches. (2) find 
the resource allocation rules from different organizational 
levels 
and 
dimensions 
(e.g. 
the 
roles 
and 
the 
organizational units).
