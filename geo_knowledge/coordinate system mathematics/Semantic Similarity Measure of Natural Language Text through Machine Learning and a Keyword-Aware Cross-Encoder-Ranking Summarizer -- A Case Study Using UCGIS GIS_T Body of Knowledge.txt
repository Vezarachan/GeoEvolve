Abstract: Initiated by the University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS), GIS&T 
Body of Knowledge (BoK) is a community-driven endeavor to define, develop, and document geospatial 
topics related to geographic information science and technologies (GIS&T). In recent years, GIS&T BoK 
has undergone rigorous development in terms of its topic re-organization and content updating, resulting 
in a new digital version of the project. While the BoK topics provide useful materials for researchers and 
students to learn about GIS, the semantic relationships among the topics, such as semantic similarity, 
should also be identified so that a better and automated topic navigation can be achieved. Currently, the 
related topics are either defined manually by editors or authors, which may result in an incomplete 
assessment of topic relationship. To address this challenge, our research evaluates the effectiveness of 
multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques in extracting semantics from text, including both 
deep neural networks and traditional machine learning approaches. Besides, a novel text summarization - 
KACERS (Keyword-Aware Cross-Encoder-Ranking Summarizer) - is proposed to generate a semantic 
summary of scientific publications. By identifying the semantic linkages among key topics, this work 
provides guidance for future development and content organization of the GIS&T BoK project. It also 
offers a new perspective on the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing scientific publications, 
and demonstrate the potential of KACERS summarizer in semantic understanding of long text documents.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
A Body of Knowledge (BoK) defines important knowledge topics to complete a job or task in a specific 
domain, and contributes to professional development needs (Stelmaszczuk-Gorska et al., 2020). Expected 
users of a BoK include educators, students, and professionals. GIS related BoK works can assist GIS 
domain curriculum planning and revision, program assessment and articulation, professional certification, 
and employee screening (Prager & Plewe, 2009; C. Wang et al., 2020). For example, GIS&T Body of 
Knowledge, or GIS&T BoK for short, represents the Geographic Information Science and Technology 
domains in a hierarchical fashion of knowledge areas, units, and topics. GIS&T BoK project is adopted 
by the American Association of Geographers as a standard GIScience learning guideline (DiBiase et al., 
2007). Encyclopedia-style BoKs have begun to include explicit cross-references or a list of related topics 
at the end of each topic, which makes it easier for knowledge seekers to explore related learning 
materials. This practice is common, just like in Wikipedia’s “see also” section, the “cross-reference” 
section also exists in the Encyclopedia of GIS (Shekhar & Xiong, 2007), Encyclopedia of Geographic 
Information Science (K. Kemp, 2008), International Encyclopedia of Geography (Brunn, 2019) , and 
GIS&T BoK. 
 
Topic relevance can be manually crafted, but it is possible to automate the process by Natural Language 
Processing (NLP). NLP is a technique to process and analyze language data, aiming to extract meanings 

 2 
(semantics) from text (Nadkarni et al., 2011). In recent years, the advances in Geospatial Artificial 
Intelligence (GeoAI) (Li, 2020, 2022) have further empowered NLP to utilize advanced AI technology 
especially deep learning to process and understand natural language text. For instance, one of the main 
research applications of NLP is to measure the semantic similarity among scientific publications for tasks 
such as cross-referencing and topic recommendation (Gargiulo et al., 2018; Nagwani, 2015). In recent 
years, the development of large language models and other deep learning models pretrained on the large 
corpus have brought significant advances for NLP. These new models are capable of learning universal 
language representations, which are beneficial for a variety of downstream NLP tasks such as semantic 
similarity measurement (Qiu et al., 2020). Semantic similarity measures the degree to which two textual 
pieces carry similar meaning and this measure has been widely used in the GIS domain to help find 
related geographic terms (Ballatore et al., 2013), match spatial entity descriptions (Ma et al., 2018), 
identify similar spatial features (Li et al., 2012), leverage spatial context semantics (B. Wang et al., 2020), 
and so on.  
 
However, the semantic similarity of GIS topics, knowledge, and publications has not been extensively 
studied and many of such tasks remain relying on manual work (Frazier et al., 2018). On the one hand, as 
it always involves large amount of time for someone to read publications with long texts and understand 
its semantics, the task for manual determination of related topics is therefore effort-intensive and may not 
be complete. For example, when contributing to GIS&T BoK, the related topic list is provided by a topic 
author who may or may not have a comprehensive knowledge of all the topics in the project. Thus, there 
is a desire to improve the process of identifying relevant topics for cross-referencing in the BoKs, 
especially with the support and automation from NLP. A few works started to investigate semantics of 
GIS related BoKs, for example, linking those BoKs with scientific papers (Du et al., 2021). However, 
understanding semantics within a BoK itself is also worth studying but yet to be exploited, and find 
appropriate NLP models to deal with lengthy BoK contents is challenging.  
 
The goal of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of different NLP techniques in automated extracting 
semantics from GIS BoK texts and uncover topic relevance. It is important to note that although GIS&T 
BoK is used as the case study in our research, the methodology is generalizable and can be applied to 
analyze other scientific publications to extract core semantic representations of each article. In our 
research, we analyze the commonalities and differences between machine-calculated relevance and 
human rankings. By comparing multiple NLP techniques, including traditional approaches and deep 
neural network models, our work can provide both the authors and audience of the GIS&T BoK with 
more accurate content recommendation. Besides, a novel summarization model - Keyword-Aware Cross-
Encoder-Ranking Summarizer (KACERS) is proposed to extract semantics from long texts effectively. 
For encyclopedia style knowledge materials using very closely related domain language (e.g., GIS 
domain), our approach is useful in obtaining a good coverage of semantic relevance without the need to 
manually edit the topics. This work also shows the potential of advanced deep learning models to gain 
new insights on semantic analytics of scientific publications. 
 
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related works in the literature. 
Section 3 presents the data, methods, and evaluation metrics used in this study. Section 4 presents and 
analyzes the results. Section 5 concludes this work and discuss future research directions.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
In this section, we first review studies on GIS related BoKs. Next, we review literatures on natural 
language processing and semantic similarity measures. Then, text summarization as a key technique for 
generating semantically condensed text is reviewed.  
2.1 GIS related BoK research 
There are many ongoing or completed GIS related BoK works. The first version of GIS&T BoK was 
introduced in 2006 by UCGIS with contributions from GIS researchers and with support of Esri to 
establish what at the time current and aspiring geospatial professionals needed to know and be able to 
implement in terms of geospatial theories, methods and tools (DiBiase et al., 2007). Initiated in 2013 and 
discussed during 2014 UCGIS Symposium, several activities yielded a new project to initiate the second 
edition of GIS&T Bok in a web-based-environment fashion (Waters, 2013; Wilson, 2014). The latest 
GIS&T BoK aims to create a more comprehensive reference work which covers both the classic theory 
and the new technology for GIS students and practitioners.  
 
There are several BoK efforts similar to GIS&T BoK. The United States Geospatial Intelligence 
Foundation conducts an analysis on cross-industry jobs, and produces Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) 
Essential Body of Knowledge (EBK) to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities critical to the 
GEOINT workforce (DiBiase et al., 2007). In Europe, the Earth Observation and Geographic Information 
(EO4GEO) BoK is developed (Hofer et al., 2020; Stelmaszczuk-Gorska et al., 2020). The EO4GEO is re-
engineered and expanded on the structure of GIS&T BoK and is focused on skill building to fill the gap 
between the supply and demand of education and training in space and geospatial sciences (Ahearn et al., 
2013). In South Africa, a university course framework (du Plessis & Van Niekerk, 2014) was developed 
and customized to meet local and international requirements based on GIT&T BoK. These projects reflect 
great interests in GIS related BoKs development by various countries, organizations, and experts.  
 
Previous works on GIS BoK mainly focus on curriculum design (Blanford et al., 2021; M. DeMers, 
2019; Elwood & Wilson, 2017; Hossain & Reinhardt, 2012; A. B. Johnson & Sullivan, 2010; K. K. 
Kemp, 2012; Prager, 2012) and skill identification (Hong, 2016; A. Johnson, 2019; Sadvari, 2019; 
Wallentin et al., 2015). Only a few semantic analysis works have been conducted to understand geospatial 
domain knowledge and essential terminologies. Actionable verbs from the learning objectives of each 
GIS&T BoK topic has semantic values in evaluating cognitive levels of each BoK entries (M. N. DeMers, 
2009). One advantage of GIS&T BoK is its depth and breadth since it covers a few hundred topics core to 
GIScience research and education. However, this also brings challenges when finding patterns and 
semantic associations between topics in practice. A structured visualization of GIS&T BoK as colored 
cells in row for curriculum assessment and evaluation (Prager & Plewe, 2009) is helpful to identify a 
revision need, but an enhancement could be made possible by revealing semantically related entities, so 
we can spot entities reflecting possible reasons of poor teaching evaluations or potential impacts of 
curriculum changes. This can be achieved through semantic similarity analysis. Content analysis is a 
popular method applied on GIS&T BoK to support curriculum design. Frazier et al. (2018) developed a 
method to match headings and subheadings of GIS textbooks with GIS&T BoK topics. However, 
semantics of those contents were captured purely manually, which is to some degree subjective and labor-
intensive. Such works can potentially benefit from automated semantic similarity analysis.

2.2 NLP and semantic similarity 
Modeling semantic similarity between textual components is an important NLP research problem, and has 
gained significant attentions by researchers from a variety of scientific domains, such as biology, geology, 
hydrology, and urban planning (Pesquita et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2021; C. Zhuang et al., 2021; D. 
Zhuang et al., 2020). The goal is to determine to what degree two textual components are semantically 
similar in terms of their content. Semantic similarity analysis extracts the semantic relationships among a 
collection of words, sentences, paragraphs, or documents. The advantage of employing machine learning 
in this process is to enable analytical capabilities that go beyond an individual person’s understanding of 
texts. Semantic similarity is useful in various NLP tasks such as information retrieval, machine 
translation, question answering, entity resolution and beyond (Ebraheem et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; 
Varelas et al., 2005; Yih et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2013). In practice, it has a wide range of real life 
applications such as patent class prediction, scientific text comparison, newspaper article similarity 
analysis, topic discovery for United Nations speeches, and concept derivation for encyclopedias (Geum & 
Kim, 2020; Gomez, 2019; Gong et al., 2019; Shalaby & Zadrozny, 2017; Watanabe & Zhou, 2020). 
Going beyond determining the semantic similarity as a binary decision (1 or 0, as similar or not), 
generating non-binary scores of text pairs followed by ranking has become a common goal of semantic 
similarity analysis. For example, a numeric score is expected to compare with human labeled score of 0-5 
for sentence representation of popular benchmarks such as the semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks 
from 2012 to 2016 (Conneau & Kiela, 2018). Although there are different measures of similarity, the 
cosine similarity has been a widely adopted approach (Mohammad & Hirst, 2012). 
 
Categorized by surveys on semantic similarity techniques (Chandrasekaran & Mago, 2021; Elavarasi et 
al., 2014), there are three major classes including knowledge-based methods, corpus-based methods, and 
deep neural network-based methods. The knowledge-based methods are based on predefined knowledge 
sources such as ontologies, dictionaries or thesauri and ontological relationships between words. Those 
methods require underlying sources to be well structured and formatted. On the other hand, corpus-based 
methods utilize information retrieved from large corpora. These approaches are welcomed and dominate 
recent works as they are free from being highly dependent on predefined knowledge sources. This class 
stems from the distributional hypothesis assuming that similar words frequently appear together 
(McDonald & Ramscar, 2001). A very important notion, word embeddings, is developed as a powerful 
approach in this class. Word embeddings provides semantically meaningful representations of words by 
vectors (Kusner et al., 2015). There are various ways to compute word embeddings, such as shallow 
neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2013) and word co-occurrence matrix (Dumais, 2004; Pennington et al., 
2014). Recently, with the increasing availability of large datasets and computing power, deep learning has 
actively pushed the boundary of semantic similarity research, and forms the third class as mentioned 
above. A neural network architecture known as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) adopts the mechanism 
of self-attention to increase model awareness of context in sequential data such as texts. An example is 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) developed by Google (Devlin et al., 
2018). Its key technical innovation is to leverage the bidirectional training of transformers to learn 
semantic dependencies of text elements (words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs) from both forward 
and backward directions. The masked language model and next structure prediction along with a huge 
amount of training data and Google’s immerse computing power distinguish BERT as a milestone 
development of sequence-to-sequence learning models (Yates et al., 2021). Transformer architectures, 

 5 
such as BERT, are therefore becoming the cutting-edge for deep semantic understanding of text 
documents of various length.  
2.3 Text summarization 
Comparing semantic similarities between texts is a non-trivial task, especially when texts are long. Text 
summarization is a useful technique because it can distill main ideas of the lengthy input into a shorter 
text (Maybury, 1999). There are two major approaches of text summarization: extractive and abstractive 
approaches (El-Kassas et al., 2021). Extractive approaches select the most informative sentences from the 
original text, while abstractive approaches paraphrase the main idea by generating new sentences. It is 
easy for some classic extractive approaches such as LexRank (Erkan & Radev, 2004) to utilize word 
embeddings for sentence scoring then identify central sentences. There are advanced neural network 
models applied on the abstractive approach such as sequence-to-sequence models which consider the 
input text as a sequence of tokens, and the output summary is a shorter sequence of tokens (Lewis et al., 
2019; Shi et al., 2021). Extractive approach leads to a higher accuracy because selected sentences are 
directly extracted from the text documents so the terms have exact appearance in the original text. 
Abstractive approach generates a more flexible summary, but the quality still needs to be improved 
because it involves generation of new text, and this remains a developing field. Several efforts have been 
made on scientific publication summarization with either approach or even hybrid approaches combining 
both strategies (Cagliero & La Quatra, 2020; Erera et al., 2019; Subramanian et al., 2019). However, very 
few works have been done in the GIScience domains (Gregory et al., 2015).  
 
To address this issue, our work develops a novel text analysis framework that can integrate multiple NLP 
methods for the semantic analysis and similarity measure of scientific publications particularly the 
GIS&T BoK. Next section describes our methodology in detail.  
3. METHODS 
As stated, the goal of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of different NLP techniques in extracting 
semantics from GIS knowledge texts to uncover topic relevance. To achieve this, a semantic data 
processing workflow for scientific publications is developed (Section 3.1). We then introduce a new 
method to improve text summarization and semantic extraction from long text (Section 3.2). Next, we 
will introduce different NLP models that can be leveraged for semantic similarity calculation (Section 
3.3). Finally, we describe the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance (Section 3.4).   
3.1 Methodological workflow 
BoK entities are complex: (1) they are documents containing several thousand words; (2) they are semi-
structured documents with predefined segments, and (3) the language may vary a lot across segments 
within one entity. Figure 1 illustrates our proposed methodological framework and workflow for 
processing natural language text especially scientific publications (e.g., BoK entries) for semantic 
similarity measurement. There are essentially three steps for processing multiple types of scientific 
publications. The first step is to identify and retrieve contents automatically from the online data source, 
such as the GIS&T BoK project page. The second step is text preprocessing, semantic modeling and 
similarity analysis. The third step is result evaluation and analysis.  

 6 
 
The starting step (Step 1 in Figure 1) is to understand the structure of publications, then prepare the data 
ready for analysis. Usually, a topic consists of several segments following an instructed structure, such as 
abstract, introduction, methodology and conclusions. Segments of interest should be identified for later 
use. At the end of each topic lays the segment which lists cross-referenced topics. Those related topics are 
used as ground-truth labels to evaluate the relevance of similar topics identified by the NLP models. 
 
Once the input text is crawled and parsed, it is sent to the core part of the pipeline (Step 2 in Figure 1) for 
text processing and modeling. Before feeding into the NLP models, the text needs to be preprocessed. 
Noisy entities and stopping words are removed to clean the text. If there is long text of interest, 
summarizer can help reduce the length while keeping salient semantics. Next, cleaned text is fed into the 
NLP models as input. Various NLP models can be employed here, including traditional approaches and 
deep neural networks, described in Section 3.3. The output is text embeddings, so that the similarity 
scores of any document pair can be calculated based on the embedded vector to identify semantic 
relevance.    
 
The results of the semantic analysis can then be evaluated (Step 3 in Figure 1). Some well-acknowledged 
metrics (Section 3.4) are used to evaluate the performance of difference models using difference text from 
different segments as inputs. This treatment allows for the calculation of document similarity based on 
different sections of the publication, helping us gain a better understanding in each section’s role and its 
semantic expressiveness of a topic.

3.2 KACERS: a keyword-aware cross-encoder-ranking summarizer 
Because some NLP models required limited length of the input text, for instance, BERT, they are less 
effective in dealing with the semantic analysis of long text documents. To utilize the power of NLP and at 
the same time present the most semantically expressive content, a summarizer is applied to find the 
sentences that represent the most important semantics though out the text. Common objectives of text 
summarizers are summary generation or further keyword extraction. It has been proved to be effective 
that adding supporting information such as human comments or aggregated topics could improve quality 
of the summary (Gao et al., 2019; W. Wang et al., 2019). However, comments could also introduce noises 
unrelated to the original contents, topics automatically generated by topic models are sets of frequent 
terms yet so-called topics are not clearly described. By comparison, keywords in the publication are easy 
to identify and understand by humans, making them a useful supporting information. It is therefore 
intuitive to take advantage of keywords if available to generate a keyword-related summary, in which 
sentences related to the defined keywords in the publications will be retrieved. Simple word-matching 
could locate relevant sentences containing a keyword, while more advanced searching methods based on 
deep learning, such as cross-encoder (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), could potentially locate more 
semantically related sentences. Cross-encoder has the power to identify related sentences by keywords, 
phrases or questions with a relevance score, which is convenient for ranking. Thus, cross-encoder has 
potential to fit this semantic summarization task as an engine to search keyword-related sentences and 
then concatenate selected sentences together as a desired summary.   
 
To achieve good summarization performance, here we propose a novel method to summarize long text 
based on keywords, named as KACERS (Keyword-Aware Cross-Encoder-Ranking Summarizer). Its 
workflow is shown in Figure 2. KACER requires two kinds of inputs - a set of keywords, and a piece of 
long text. First, text is split into sentences. Then keywords and sentences are passed into a transformer-
based cross-encoder. For each keyword-sentence pair, two vectors are generated by a cross-encoder 
(Reimers & Gurevych 2019) to represent a keyword and a sentence, respectively. Different from the 
vectorization process of a bi-encoder, a cross-encoder simultaneously pays attention to both the keyword 
and the sentence, whereas a bi-encoder calculate the vector based on limited attention to only one of 
them. Therefore, the cross-encoder increases the awareness of the keyword in the vector representation of 
the sentences, and vice versa. For each keyword-sentence pair, a cosine similarity score is calculated to 
derive how similar a sentence is to a given keyword. Ranking all the possible pairs based on the similarity 
score, each keyword has found a list of most similar sentences (i.e., top sentences). The t in KACERS-t 
controls the top t most similar sentences selected for each keyword. Finally, KACERS-t generates a 
summary of the input text by concatenating these top t sentences found for each given keyword. This new 
summary contains semantically rich information to represent the original text and is much shorter in 
length. It is therefore suitable for use in multiple NLP models which requires the input text to be within a 
certain length.

3.3 NLP models for semantic similarity 
This paper evaluates six popular models to explore the semantic similarity of knowledge topics in Step 2 
of our proposed data processing pipeline (Figure 1). We distinguish between two model categories: (1) 
traditional text-based and shallow machine learning models, and (2) deep learning models. The models 
derive a semantic representation (i.e., a high-dimensional vector) of different text documents and then 
similarity measure is performed on these represented vectors.    
3.3.1 Traditional text-based models and shallow machine learning models 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): In natural language processing, TF-IDF (Ramos, 2003) is a 
fundamental term-weighting model based on word numeric statistics. Instead of pure lexical match like 
TF-IDF, LSA (Dumais, 2004) improves it by detecting semantic representations from a large corpus of 
text with the idea of dimensionality reduction (Li et al., 2014). It has some assumptions: meanings of 
sentences or documentation are given by the aggregation of all words in it; in a large corpus, associations 
between words can only exist implicitly. For LSA, a term-document matrix is first generated, where each 
row represents the document, and each column is given by the terms in all the documents. A low-rank 
approximation technique called truncated singular value decomposition is used to reduce unimportant 
dimensions of the term-document matrix to make the semantic association better shown in the reproduced 
matrix.  
 
Global Vectors (GloVe): GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) is another shallow machine learning model 
based on word count. It conducts statistics based on both local context and the entire corpus. It utilizes the 
co-occurrence matrix to make predictions of the probabilities of words in a text to derive its semantic 
vectors. In another word, it tries to leverage the fact that a certain word is more inclined to be present with 
another word than any other words in the corpus. GloVe produces dense embedding representations. In 
terms of computation, due to the addition of the weighting function, it scales well from small corpuses to 
large ones. Additionally, it caps the occurrence of frequent words (such as the and they) so that the 
distribution will not be too large and can successfully capture the gist of less frequent but important 
words.  
 
Doc2vec: The idea of Doc2vec in learning paragraph vectors stems from Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 
2013), the task of which is to predict certain words given some context words. In Word2vec, context 
words act as feature vectors during prediction to represent semantics of a specific word. Doc2vec extends 
this idea toward processing long documents to generate a feature vector to represent each document in the 

 9 
corpus, but it remains a shallow neural network model with a single hidden layer. A popular Doc2vec 
technique is the model with distributed memory and distributed bag of words (Le & Mikolov, 2014), 
which is used in our study.  
3.3.2 Deep learning models 
RoBERTa: Introduced by Facebook, RoBERTa is a derivative of BERT with improved training 
methodology such as dynamic masking and more training data than BERT. RoBERTa aims to predict 
intentionally masked words within unannotated datasets. It mainly involves the modification of 
hyperparameters in the BERT model by employing dynamic masking and removing the loss function for 
the next-sentence prediction. Additionally, it trains on larger batches and chooses a different token 
compression method, i.e., larger byte-pair encoding. As a result, RoBERTa outperforms BERT on several 
benchmarks such as the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) (Liu et al., 2019).  
 
SciBERT and Scientific Paper Embeddings Citation informed TransformERs (SPECTER): SciBERT 
(Beltagy et al., 2019) and SPECTER (Cohan et al., 2020) apply pretrained BERT models to academic 
research, using scientific publications as the corpus to further refine the model. SciBERT mainly focuses 
on the massive corpus of academic publications from Semantic Scholar based on BERT. Full text of 
papers involving widespread domains is used for model training. It substantially improves the 
performance of model prediction results from a scientific data - NLP perspective. SPECTER achieves 
document embeddings of academic publications with the assistance of a transformer language model. It 
and combines additional scientific domain specific context with the Transformer language models to learn 
a representation of the original text documents.  
 
Although BERT is a great milestone in NLP, previous research also finds that the architecture of BERT 
makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search and clustering (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). Thus, 
some efforts have been done to tackle this shortage and improve the performance of BERT related 
models, and the siamese network architecture they employed helps to generate “semantically meaningful” 
sentence embeddings. The siamese structure (Schroff et al., 2015) is an artificial neural network that uses 
the same weights while working in tandem on two different input vectors to compute comparable output 
vectors. For fine-tuning BERT, siamese network was used to update the weights to make the embeddings 
semantically meaningful to enable comparison using cosine similarity. Furthermore, SBERT significantly 
outperformed state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods such as InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017) and 
Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018) on seven semantic textual similarity tasks. As a family of 
several BERT related models, RoBERTa and SPECTER in SBERT version are available off the shelf.  
3.4 Evaluation and analysis metrics 
As reviewed, cosine similarity is used to measure the semantic distance between two textual pieces. After 
text vectors are produced by an NLP model, the cosine of the angle between any two vectors (A and B in 
Eq. [1]) can be calculated (Landauer et al., 1998), as shown in Equation (1). The result has a value range 
of [0,1], with 0 indicating the least similar documents and 1 indicating the most similar documents. In the 
context of BoK semantic modeling, consine similarity is used to measure the similarity between two 
topics. Each topic is represented as a high-dimensional vector, with each dimension corresponding to a 
particular semantic feature. Cosine similarity then provides a measure of the cosine of the angle between 

 10
two vectors, which can be used to determine the similarity between two topics. A cosine similarity score 
of 1 indicates that two topics are very similar or even identical, while a score of 0 indicates that the two 
topics are completely dissimilar. In other words, the higher the cosine similarity score, the more similar 
the two topics are in terms of their semantic features.

As in pipeline Step 3 (Figure 1), to evaluate related topics proposed by those models based on semantic 
similarities, common metrics of recall, precision, F-measure score, and balanced accuracy are used. These 
metrics focus on comparisons of the candidate topic set promoted by the model to related topics 
determined by manual judgements. Although a comprehensive list of pairwise similarities is accessible, 
many information retrieval studies have demonstrated that users of retrieval systems tend to pay attention 
mostly to top-ranked results which represent high relevance (Hofmann et al., 2014; Lagun et al., 2014). 
Here, we largely follow the annotation of NLP common practice (Mitra & Craswell, 2018). For each 
query topic, top k candidate topics ranked by similarity scores, are truncated to use and referred to as R. In 
this sense, Rq@1 means the most similar topic, Rq@10 means top ten similar topics to a query topic q. 
Recall and precision (Eq. [2] and Eq. [3]) both compute the fraction of relevant topics promoted for q, but 
with respect to the total number of related documents identified by humans as a collection D, and the total 
document number of Rq, respectively. F-measure (Eq. [4]) combines recall and precision and focuses on 
the capability of detecting positives. Balanced accuracy (Eq. [5]) is used considering imbalanced true 
labels, which normalized true positive and true negative predictions by the number of positive and 
negative samples, respectively, and divided their sum by two.

4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
4.1 Experiments  
Following the proposed pipeline, we evaluate the effectiveness of different NLP techniques in extracting 
semantics from GIS knowledge texts and uncover their semantic relevance. The latest version of GIS&T 
BoK (2021 3rd quarter)1 at the time of writing is used. At Step 1, BoK topics are categorized into ten 
knowledge areas, including Foundational Concepts (FC), Knowledge Economy (KE), Computing 
Platforms (CP), Computer programming and Development (PD), Data Capture (DC), Data Management 
(DM), Analytics and Modeling (AM), Cartography and Visualization (CV), Domain Applications (DA), 
GIS&T and Society (GS). These topics follow a structure containing several segments. In our work, the 
most interesting segments of Title, Keyword, Abstract, Main, Learning Objectives (LearnObj for short), 
 
1 https://gistbok.ucgis.org/archives/2021-quarter-03 

 11
Instructional Assessment Questions (IAQ for short), are selected for analysis. Abstract is the author 
summary of a topic, usually containing one or two paragraphs. Main is the main body of a BoK topic, 
which contains detailed descriptions of this topic. Learning Objectives are listed in bullet points.  
Instructional Assessment Questions serve as a way for evaluating student learning outcomes.  
 
A topic example can be found as “CP-14 - Web GIS” where CP denoted the knowledge area “Computing 
Platforms”, 14 is the topic identifier, “WebGIS” is the topic name, it is about a technique “allows the 
sharing of GIS data, maps, and spatial processing across private and public computer networks”. After 
deciding on segments of interest, we crawl and parse these textual segments from GIS&T BoK websites. 
At the end of a GIS&T BoK topic, there are some related topics listed by editors or writers.  On average, 
each topic lists three related topics and they are used as the ground-truth labels to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the machine ranked results. Note that, the list of relevant topics is longer for some BoK 
entity and shorter for others, creating an imbalanced training dataset. 
 
Six models, LSA, GloVe, RoBERTa, SPECTER, SciBERT, and Doc2vec are used to conduct semantic 
analysis and identify similar topics. The Gensim library2 is employed for LSA and related text 
preprocessing. A key parameter of LSA model is the number of topics. Based on the GIS&T BoK 
hierarchy, the amount of knowledge area (10) and units (53) are both tested as the topic number, and 
setting topic numbers as 53 always yields better performance. For GloVe model, the common version 
with 840B tokens, 2.2M vocabularies, cased, and 300 dimensional vectors as output is used from Hugging 
Face3. The Sentence Transformers library4 is used for RoBERTa and SPECTER models where all-
roberta-large-v1, allenai-specter were used respectively. The required inputs of SPECTER model are the 
title and abstract of a paper, so the corresponding sections in the BoK topic is sent to the model. SciBERT 
was from the Allen Institute for AI5 in the version of scibert_scivocab_uncased. For Doc2vec, the 
preprocessing is the same as what is applied to LSA. We pass all the GIS-T BoK text by the Gensim 
phrases module to form bi-grams and tri-grams to capture some phrases such as “remote sensing”, 
“geographic information system”, and so on. Stopwords such as “the”, “a” are removed, and the rest are 
tokenized and passed to the Gensim Doc2vec6 for training. To implement the KACERS summarizer, a 
cross-encoder of BERT with 2 layers pretrained on the MS MARCO dataset7 is employed. Although other 
larger pretrained models are available for better performance but they run much slower than the 2-layer 
version, so here we use a simpler model to demonstrate the feasibility of KACERS.  
 
Of the evaluation metrics, recall is the most important measure as the goal is to find more true positives 
between human proposed related topics and that identified by the machine. Balanced accuracy is the 
second most important metric because it reflects the overall capability of models especially considering 
imbalanced data. F-score and Precision are also calculated, but they are expected to decrease along with 
the increase of k (the number of candidate topics ranked by similarity scores), especially after all true

labels are found. To answer the research question, model performance comparison and outputs analysis 
are reported in section 4.2.  
4.2 Results 
4.2.1 Model performance on original segments  
We first evaluate how much semantics each original segment carries for performing semantic similarity 
comparison of two topics and which model provides the best recall (the highest consistency between the 
human and machine rankings). There are three categories of segments considering length and content. 
The first category is short segments including Title and Keyword. Although both segments provide 
phrases rather than complete sentences, they contain the most semantically expressive keywords about a 
topic. Intuitively, Title conveys very limited semantics because short titles are preferred to make the topic 
general and easy to understand in the BoK project.  
 
Figure 3 lists the best-performed model taking different segments as input for the semantic analysis. As 
seen, RoBERTa works best in extracting most similar topics based on Title and Abstract (first and third 
column) because this model is pretrained on a lot of general corpuses which helps to understand the 
semantic meanings of short texts. The GloVe model using Keyword as input yields higher recall than 
RoBERTa taking Title as input, because GloVe takes advantage of aggregated word-word cooccurrence, 
which can represent the keyword-keyword cooccurrence in BoK entities very well. Compared to Title and 
Keywords, Abstract contains more semantics about a topic, hence the recall rate using Abstract for the 
semantic analysis is higher than using the other two segments. RoBERTa achieves the best performance 
than the other models when processing information in the Abstract, due to its novel strategy of attention-
based context understanding. This model, however, does not work as well as Doc2Vec when processing 
Main (containing content in both Abstract and Main segments), because (1) the two segments together 
contain the most semantics of a topic; and (2) Doc2Vec is good at processing long texts to extract 
semantically meaningful features while the other models, such as RoBERTa, have a limit in the input 
length. Not surprisingly, models taking LearnObj and IAQ as input do not show as good performance (in 
terms of recall rate) as others, because the contents in LearnObj and IAQ are mostly about information 
used to support teaching and learning, so the semantics in them may not be directly related to a topic.  
 

 13
 
Figure 3.  Comparison of model performance taking different BoK segments as input.  
This result is based on the top 10 (@10) most similar topics ranked by the best-performed models using 
some segment (e.g., Title) as input.  
 
From the above analysis, we can tell that, the RoBERTa model which takes a much shorter text -- the 
Abstract as input yields almost as good performance as the Doc2Vec model taking nearly the entire 
document as input. Two issues limit the performance of the RoBERTa model here: (1) although the 
Abstract contains semantic description about a topic, the level of semantics is still confined to its length 
(e.g., 100 words); (2) RoBERTa is better at processing short text, and it limits the input token (i.e., a 
sequence of characters as a semantic unit) size to be 512. That means, input longer than 512 tokens will 
be truncated, resulting in a loss of data semantics. This motivates us to conduct further semantic analysis, 
especially semantic summarization of the original text to use a much shorter but near semantically-
equivalent summary as the input data to fully utilize strengths of the RoBERTa model. Next section 
describes results based on our proposed method.  
4.2.2 Model performance on semantic summary 
Following the motivation stated above, the goal of this subsection is to generate a new topic summary 
containing more semantics than any of the individual segments in the original document to empower the 
semantic analysis by multiple models. The idea of semantic summary is to conduct a semantic 
summarization using our proposed KACERS summarizer on both Abstract and Main, and use the 
combined summary as input for topic relevance analysis. The KACERS summarizer can select the top n 
(n=1, 2, 3...) most similar sentences in a text segment given any keyword, which allows us to generate 
multiple semantic summaries when n is set to different values. Table 1 shows the recall rate achieved 
using the RoBERTa model by taking different semantic summary as input. The row and column labels 
show the parameters (n=1,2,3) used in KACERS to generate the semantic summary from Main and 
Abstract respectively. For instance, the cell in the third row and third column has a value of 0.6578; it 
means that by using RoBERTa and taking the combined summarized Main (n=1 in KACERS) and 
original Abstract as input, the best recall is achieved based on top 10 most relevant topic and the score is 
0.6578. Column-wise, the improvement in recall (% value in parentheses) compared with the first 
observed value (using Abstract alone) is presented. The improvement is obvious with injections of the 

 14
summary from Main, as it provides additional, useful semantics. The improvement is observed even 
directly attaching the summarized Main produced by KACERS (at n=1, 2, or 3) to the original Abstract 
(values in the third column). However, this column does not act as the overall best summarizer, indicating 
that a balance between deliveries of Abstract and Main is important. The summarized Abstract obtained 
by KACERS at n=2 combined with the summarized Main obtained by KACERS at n=3 yields this the 
highest recall score of 0.6927. And this result is also better than that using any original segment as input 
(Figure 3).  We name this best summary combination as Semantic Summary for later reference.

Also, Semantic Summary generated by KACERS is compared with combinations of related segments - 
Title, Abstract, Keyword, and Main - without KACERS (Figure 4). The first column shows the best 
recall@10 value achieved by GloVe by taking the combination of short segments (Title + Keyword) as 
input. As seen, the recall rate (0.5859) is better than using either original segment as input (respective 
results are shown in Figure 3), and this is again consistent with our intuition that those two segments are 
valuable and compensate with each other. GloVe using the combined Title and Keyword as input 
outperforms other models because data in this combination contains words and phrases where word-word 
cooccurrence plays an important role in semantic similarity. The second column lists the recall rate by 
taking longer segments (Title + Keyword + Abstract + Main) as input. RoBERTa model achieves the best 
recall@10 on this combination. It again surpasses results using any individual segment as input (Figure 
3). RoBERTa achieves the overall best recall rate using the Semantic Summary as input because (1) as 
summarized text carries more semantic information, and (2) attention-based context understanding 
mechanism adopted in RoBERTa is powerful in conducting semantic analysis of short texts.

most similar topics ranked by the best-performed models using some segment combination. 
 
Figure 5 further illustrates the performance comparison of different deep learning model using the 
Semantic Summary as the input. X axis shows the increase in k when it is used as the parameter to select 
the top ranked similar topics by the machine to conduct the evaluation. Y axis shows the performance 
score using different metrics. In general, the best model achieves the highest recall and balanced accuracy 
at the same time. The best recall 0.6927, is achieved by model RoBERTa when k=10. It also has the 
highest balanced accuracy when k=10, 0.8161. In other words, the Semantic Summary serves as a great 
semantic representation of a BoK topic. The results can also tell that when k increases from 1 to 10, both 
recall and the balanced accuracy increase. This trend shows that NLP models get better performance if we 
allow them to suggest more similar topics. In the “Recall” subplot, RoBERTa outperforms the other 
models on almost all choices of k. For models pre-trained in scientific literature, SPECTER works better 
than SciBERT. Although SciBERT claims to achieve high scores on some NLP tasks, it was originally 
trained on biomedical domain papers. This pretraining bias is exposed in this GIS domain task. LSA 
generally performs better than GloVe. The text length of Semantic Summary is short for Doc2vec to 
achieve a good performance.   
 
Models excel in precision when fewer top k sentences suggested by the model is considered, and then 
trend down as k increases. The reason is that the related topic list is on average short as mentioned in 
section 4.1, containing only a few topics (e.g., 2-3). Models achieve over 40% precision when k=1 
reflecting that there is a high chance that they can correctly find at least one same topic as provided by the 
topic authors. The more relevant candidates identified by a machine is considered, the more topics will be 
found. Thus, the precision score drops quickly. This short relevance characteristic also explains the abrupt 
summit of F-score near k=2 for most models. After k=2, the declination of precision is higher than the 
increase of recall, so we can observe a drop in the F-score. Based on this, precision and F-score are not 
very meaningful metrics for this GIS&T BoK similarity task when k is high, but recall and balanced 
accuracy are still valuable.

4.2.3 A running example for the machine-ranked and human-ranked similar topics  
We use NLP models to find the relevance between GIS&T BoK topics and provide top k related topics. 
As compared above, Semantic Summary produced by KACERS serves as the best semantic 
representation, and RoBERTa is the best model on that achieves the highest recall@10 for similarity 
ranking. Here we provide an example to show the differences in machine-ranked results and author-
identified relevant topics. According to the machine ranking, the ten most similar topics of “GS-14 - GIS 
and Critical Ethics” (i.e., Rq=GS-14) are listed in Table 2. This (seed) topic discusses critical ethics and GIS, 
exploring how spatial data can mask, conceal or disallow knowledge, and suggests using concepts from 
educational pedagogy to enrich GIS experience, pointing to the practical, empirical and political nature of 
ethical critique. This is an important research area that may engage with interdisciplinary debates.  
 
Here, some related topics ignored by humans are found by our model, such as the top-ranked topic “GS-
11 - Professional and Practical Ethics of GIS&T”. There is a difference between ethics in GS-14 and 
ethics in GS-11 because the latter is more on the operational level, but they are closely related. As for 
consistency, “GS-13 - Epistemological critiques” and “GS-15 - Feminist Critiques of GIS” fulfill the 
related topic list provided by humans. In this case, recall@4 reaches 100%.  
 

 17
Referring to BoK’s hierarchical structure8, we can further analyze similar topics within the hierarchy. As 
introduced in Section 1, GIS&T BoK has an inherent hierarchy, which includes knowledge areas, units, 
then topics. In Table 2, half of the top 10 similar topics and the top four most similar topics are all from 
the GIS&T and Society (GS) knowledge area as the seed topic, two of which are identified by the authors. 
The algorithm also finds similar topics from a number of other knowledge areas, such as “DA-11 - 
GIS&T and the Digital Humanities” from Domain Application (DA) knowledge area. This demonstrate 
that NLP has the potential assisting people to uncover more possibilities of connectivity than we used to 
think about, where the latent similarity exists across units and knowledge areas.

4.2.4 Analysis on intra-KA similarity and inter-KA similarity of machine ranked similar topics 
The following analysis provides a comprehensive view of intra-KA similarity and inter-KA similarity of 
GIS&T BoK topics. Although the current BoK design has grouped the topics into distinct categories, 
related topics can still be found across different knowledge areas, as demonstrated by both human labels 
and NLP model-generated candidates. This is reasonable considering all the topics are in the GIS domain, 
which is interdisciplinary in nature. Figure 6 presents two directed chord plots and a bar chart that 
visualize semantic similarity of topics within and across knowledge areas. Knowledge areas are arranged 
radially around a circle and relationships in between are drawn as chords. A chord and the seed topic’s 
knowledge area share the same color, for instance, a blue chord between “Foundational Concepts” in blue 
and “Domain Applications” in green indicates that a seed topic from “Foundational Concepts” has a 
relevant candidate belonging to “Domain Applications”. If a knowledge area has chords curving to itself, 
then there exists intra-similarity of tropics within knowledge area. Comparing similarity@1 (Figure 6a) 
and similarity@10 (Figure 6b), we notice that the overall chord distribution pattern looks alike, while the 
latter has more dense chords. Despite the observed inter-similarity and intra-similarity, the interaction of 
similarity may vary among different knowledge areas.

(c) intra-KA similarity@10, sum of self-curving chords per KA;  
(d) inter-KA similarity@10, sum of chord heads per KA;  
(e) inter-KA similarity@10, sum of chord tails per KA. 
 
Figure 6c presents statistics of similarity@10. The knowledge area “Cartography and Visualization” (red 
bar) has the highest intra-KA similarity, indicating that topics within area are highly interconnected. 
Additionally, to determine the highest inter-similarity between knowledge areas, we compared the sums 
of the chord heads and chord tails, respectively. A head is a seed topic, and a tail is a similar candidate of 
the seed topic. An interesting observation is that GIS&T BoK topics tend to start from “Foundational 
Concepts” and end at “Domain Applications”. This suggests that our model has effectively captured the 
semantics and human knowledge within the this BoK, as it reflects the general understanding that a 
domain typically expands from concepts to applications. 
5. DISCUSSION 
Our approach has several potential applications including assisting BoK authors and editors to quickly 
create and update of the “Related Topics” section of each entry. We recommend that when the BoK 
project reaches a stable stage, each topic author will be contacted with several suggested topics of high 
relevance identified by our proposed machine learning model. A list of top 10 related topics would be a 
good starting point. Our finding (Figure 4) suggests that there should be a near 70% chance that the top 
10 topic list contains results highly consistent with the human labels. The authors can rank according to 
their knowledge and expertise which are relevant and which are not. These answers will be very valuable 
for further analysis when both relevance and irrelevance topics are logged.  
 

 19
There are some limitations of the proposed work. The good performance of KACERS relies on high-
quality keywords. However, in order to provide high-quality keywords, a topic author should have solid 
domain knowledge and minimize human bias. The quantity, scope, and expandability of keywords will 
affect quality of keywords. When the BoK expands and includes new topics, the chosen set may be 
constrained if the keywords to be chosen are predefined. Even though the keyword list is extendable, 
choosing whether to include a new keyword that is on the margins of GIS might be challenging. This 
ambiguity is obvious when authors address topics in Domain Applications that are of specific interest. It 
could be amplified when authors come from a marginalized group of scholars. This uncertainty will have 
an effect on both the summary process and the semantic similarity. 
 
Another point worth mentioning is that, although consistent with domain experts’ intuition, the learning 
objective segment and instructional assessment question segments are not suitable for the semantic 
similarity task, instead their semantics can be used for other purposes. For example, sentences in Learning 
Objectives usually start with action verbs such as “explain”, “distinguish”.  Sentences in Instructional 
Assessment Questions usually start with question verbs such as “how”, “what”, “why”. Those words 
imply interconnections between notions mentioned in the text. If we can recognize those notions and link 
them to topics, then it is possible to present more relationships between topics and further support the 
different knowledge exploration needs. 
6. CONCLUSION 
This work introduces several state-of-the-art models to explore the semantic relations between knowledge 
topics to advance relevance discovery in body of knowledge. The GIS&T Body of Knowledge project is 
used as a use case. Our paper makes three contributions. First, a BoK topic has many segments and the 
level of semantics expressed in each of these segments is quite different. To better understand how well 
they can deliver the core message of the topic, the semantic analysis of different topic segments is 
conducted. Second, in order to create a better semantic representation of a topic, a novel summarizer 
called KACERS is created. KACERS successfully completes the challenge of comparing the semantics of 
long texts and produces a semantic summary that is both an accurate semantic representation of the 
original text and substantially shorter in length. This way, it allows NLP models which have limits in 
input data size to better demonstrate their power. A reduced input data amount also makes the machine 
learning process more efficient. The generated semantic summary is also very easy to comprehend and 
evaluate. Third, we implement various models to extract semantics from different segments of BoK 
topics. Effectiveness of traditional NLP models, generally pre-trained models and academic domain pre-
trained models are compared and evaluated. We discuss model performance for each segment and give 
insights on pairwise relevance based on the best model.  
 
Our experiments demonstrated the power of pre-trained natural language processing models to understand 
semantics of BoK. The proposed framework can also assist iterations of other geospatial BoKs such as the 
Encyclopedia of Mathematical Geosciences, or GIScience scholars who want to summarize or compare 
semantics of acknowledged geospatial knowledge. There has been a pursuit of achieving higher 
performance based on custom models in the past years. However, utilizing pre-trained models shouldn’t 
be ignored (Qiu et al., 2020). A general purpose of a body of knowledge is to serve people with different 
knowledge backgrounds, which means their understanding of text is more general than a domain expert, 

 20
which influences their relevance judgement. Moreover, it is easier to scale up the relevance retrieval 
capability with more incoming topics if the model is out-of-the-box and ready to use with a good 
performance. We vision the ultimate goal of various bodies of knowledge shouldn’t be confined within a 
specific domain. If we want to build a comprehensive knowledge graph consisting of BoKs from different 
domains such as a comprehensive body of geography, urban planning, and economics, a general pipeline 
built upon pre-trained model can serve as an efficient solution to discover relevance between topics, 
ensuring its transferrability and reproducibility (Goodchild & Li, 2021). And here, we demonstrate the 
potential of deep learning models, such as RoBERTa, in achieving this goal.
