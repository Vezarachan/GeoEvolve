Abstract. We consider an optimal control problem Q governed by an elliptic quasivariational
inequality with unilateral constraints. The existence of optimal pairs of the problem is a well
known result, see [28], for instance. We associate to Q a new optimal control problem eQ, obtained
by perturbing the state inequality (including the set of constraints and the nonlinear operator) and
the cost functional, as well. Then, we provide suﬃcient conditions which guarantee the convergence
of solutions of Problem eQ to a solution of Problem Q. The proofs are based on convergence
results for elliptic quasivariational inequalities, obtained by using arguments of compactness,
lower semicontinuity, monotonicity, penalty and various estimates. Finally, we illustrate the use
of the abstract convergence results in the study of optimal control associated with two boundary
value problems. The ﬁrst one describes the equilibrium of an elastic body in frictional contact
with an obstacle, the so-called foundation. The process is static and the contact is modeled with
normal compliance and unilateral constraint, associated to a version of Coulomb’s law of dry
friction. The second one describes a stationary heat transfer problem with unilateral constraints.
For the two problems we prove existence, uniqueness and convergence results together with the
corresponding physical interpretation.

Introduction
The study of optimal control problems is motivated by important applications in Physics,
Mechanics, Automatics and Systems Theory. For instance, the control of mathematical
models which describe the contact of deformable bodies, as well as their optimal shape
design, is of considerable theoretical and applied interest in Civil Engineering, Automotive
Industry and Mechanics of Structures. Moreover, the control of the temperature ﬁeld in
heat transfer proccesses is important in various industrial settings like metal forming, among
others.
Most of the models in Physics, Mechanics and Engineering Science are expressed in
terms of strongly nonlinear boundary value problems with partial diﬀerential equations
which, in a weak formulation, lead to variational inequalities. The theory of variational
inequalities was developed based on arguments of monotonicity and convexity, including
properties of the subdiﬀerential of a convex function. Because of their importance in en-
gineering applications, a considerable eﬀort has been put into their analysis, control and
numerical simulations and the literature in the ﬁeld is extensive. Basic references in the
ﬁeld are [1, 6, 12, 16, 18], for instance. Results in the study of optimal control for variational
and variational-hemivariational inequalities have been discussed in several works, including
[2, 3, 11, 17, 22, 23, 24] and [27, 29], respectively. Applications of variational inequalities
in Mechanics could be found in the books [8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 26], for instance. Refer-
ence on optimal control for inequality problems arising in Mechanics and Physics include
[4, 5, 7, 19, 20, 21, 25, 28, 32].
In this paper we consider an optimal control problem for a general class of elliptic
quasivariational inequalities. The functional framework is the following: X and Y are real
Hilbert spaces endowed with the inner products (·, ·)X and (·, ·)Y , respectively, K ⊂X,
A : X →X, j : X × X →IR, f ∈Y and π : X →Y . Then, the inequality problem we
consider is the following.
Problem P. Find u such that
u ∈K,
(Au, v −u)X + j(u, v) −j(u, u) ≥(f, πv −πu)Y
∀v ∈K.
(1.1)
We associate to Problem P the set of admissible pairs deﬁned by
Vad = { (u, f) ∈K × Y such that (1.1) holds }
(1.2)
and we consider a cost functional L : X × Y →R. Here and below, X × Y represents the
product of the Hilbert spaces X and Y , equipped with the canonical inner product. Then,
the optimal control problem we study in this paper is the following.
Problem Q. Find (u∗, f ∗) ∈Vad such that
L(u∗, f ∗) =
min
(u,f)∈Vad L(u, f).
(1.3)
Next, consider a set eK ⊂X, an operator eA : X →X and an element ef ∈Y . With
these data we construct the following perturbation of Problem P.
2

Problem eP. Find eu such that
eu ∈eK,
( eAeu, v −eu)X + j(eu, v) −j(eu, eu) ≥( ef, πv −πeu)Y
∀v ∈eK.
(1.4)
We associate to Problem eP the set of of admissible pairs given by
eVad = { (eu, ef) ∈eK × Y such that (1.4) holds }
(1.5)
and, for a cost functional eL : X × Y →R, we construct the following perturbation of the
optimal control problem Q.
Problem eQ. Find (eu∗, ef
∗) ∈eVad such that
eL(eu∗, ef
∗) =
min
(eu, ef )∈eV ad
eL(eu, ef).
(1.6)
The unique solvability of problems P and eP, on one hand, and the solvability of problems
Q and eQ, on the other hand, follow from well known results obtained in the literature, under
appropriate assumptions on the data. Here, we shall use the existence and uniqueness results
in [28], which will be resumed in the next section.
Now, a brief comparation between problems P and eP shows that Problem eP is obtained
from Problem P by replacing the set K with the set eK, the operator A with the operator eA
and the element f with ef. A similar remark can be made concerning the optimal problems
Q and eQ, in which the set Vad was replaced by the set eVad and the functional L was
replaced with eL. Therefore, since problems eP and e
Q represent perturbations of P and
Q, respectively, a natural question is to establish the link between the solutions of these
problems.
In this paper we provide a partial answer to the question above. Our aim is three
folds. The ﬁrst one is to formulate suﬃcient assumptions on the data which guarantee the
convergence of the solution eu of Problem eP to the solution u of Problem P. Our result in
this matter is Theorem 4 below, which represents the ﬁrst novelty of this paper. Our second
aim is to prove that, under appropriate conditions, the solutions of Problem eQ converge
to a solution of Problem Q. Our result in this matter is Theorem 6, which represent the
second novelty of this work. Finally, our third aim is to illustrate the use of these abstract
results in the study of two relevant examples. The ﬁrst one arises from Contact Mechanics
and the second one describe a heat transfer process.
The rest of this manuscript is structured as follows. In Section 2 we resume the exis-
tence and uniqueness results in [28] obtained in the study of problems P and Q. Then,
in Section 3 we state and prove our main result concerning the link between the solutions
of problems P and eP, Theorem 4. In Section 4 we state and prove our main result con-
cerning the link between the solutions of problems Q and eQ, Theorem 6. The proofs of
the theorems are based on arguments of compactness, lower semicontinuity, monotonicity,
penalty and various estimates. In Section 5 we illustrate these abstract results in the study
of a mathematical model which describes the frictional contact of an elastic material with
a rigid-deformable foundation. The process is static and the contact is described with nor-
mal compliance and unilateral constraint, associated to a version of Coulomb’s law of dry
friction. We apply the abstract result in Sections 3 and 4 in the study of this problem and
3

provide the corresponding mechanical interpretations. We end this paper with Section 6
in which we prove that Theorems 4 and 6 can be used to obtain a version of our previous
convergence results obtained in [4], in the study of a heat transfer model with unilateral
constraints.

Problem statement and preliminaries
In Sections 2–4 below we use the functional framework described in the Introduction and we
denote by ∥·∥X, ∥·∥Y the norms on the spaces X and Y , respectively. All the limits, upper
and lower limits below are considered as n →∞, even if we do not mention it explicitly.
The symbols “⇀” and “→” denote the weak and the strong convergence in various spaces
which will be speciﬁed, except in the case when these convergence take place in R.
In the study of Problem P we consider the following assumptions.

We now recall the following existence and uniqueness result, proved in [28].
Theorem 1 Assume that (2.1)–(2.6) hold. Then, the quasivariational inequality (1.1) has
a unique solution.
In the study of Problem Q we assume that

The following existence result was obtained in [28].
Theorem 2 Assume that (2.1)–(2.4), (2.6)–(2.13), Then, there exists at least one solution
(u∗, f ∗) ∈Vad of Problem Q.
The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are based on arguments of compactness, lower semi-
continuity and monotonicity. We shall use these theorems in Sections 3 and 4 below, in the
study of speciﬁc perturbed versions of problems P and Q.

A convergence result
In this section we state and prove a convergence result for the solution of Problem eP, in
the case when this problem has a speciﬁc structure. To this end, we consider two sequences
{λn} ⊂R, {fn} ⊂Y and an operator G : X →X. For each n ∈N let An : X →X be the
operator deﬁned by
Anu = Au + 1
λn
Gu
∀u ∈X,
(3.1)
and denote by Pn the following version of Problem eP, obtained with eA = An and ef = fn.
Problem Pn. Find un such that
un ∈eK,
(Aun, v −un)X + 1
λn
(Gun, v −un)X + j(un, v) −j(un, un)
(3.2)
≥(fn, πv −πun)Y
∀v ∈eK.
5

Note that in the case when eK = X, under appropriate assumptions on G, Problem Pn
represents a penalty problem of P. Penalty methods have been widely used in the literature
as an approximation tool to treat constraints in variational inequalities, as explained in
[12, 15, 30] and the references therein.
To prove the unique solvability of Problem Pn we use the following assumptions.
eK is a nonempty, closed, convex subset of X.
(3.3)
G : X →X is a monotone Lipschitz continuous operator.
(3.4)
λn > 0
∀n ∈N.
(3.5)
fn ∈Y
∀n ∈N.
(3.6)
We have the following existence and uniqueness result.
Proposition 3 Assume (2.2)–(2.4), (2.6), (3.3)–(3.6). Then, for each n ∈N, there exists
a unique solution un ∈X to Problem Pn.
Proof. Let n ∈N. Assumptions (2.2), (3.4), (3.5) imply that the operator An satisﬁes
inequality (2.2)(a) with the same constant m as the operator A and, moreover, it is Lipschitz
continuous. We conclude from above that the operator An satisﬁes condition (2.2). Recall
also assumptions (3.3) and (3.6) on eK and fn, respectively. These properties allows us to
use Theorem 1 with eK, An and fn instead of K, A and f, respectively. In this way we
obtain the unique solvability of the inequality (3.2) which concludes the proof.
□
To study the behavior of the solution of Problem Pn as n →∞we consider the following
additional hypotheses.
λn →0
as
n →∞.
(3.7)
fn ⇀f
in
Y
as
n →∞.
(3.8)
K ⊂eK.
(3.9)



(a)
(Gu, v −u)X ≤0
∀u ∈eK, v ∈K
(b)
u ∈eK,
(Gu, v −u)X = 0
∀v ∈K
=⇒
u ∈K.
(3.10)
Note that, in the case when eK = X, condition (3.10) is satisﬁed for any penalty operator
of the set K, see Deﬁnition 23 in [31] for details.
Our main result in this section is the following.
Theorem 4 Assume (2.1)–(2.6), (2.10)–(2.13), (3.3)–(3.10) and, for each n ∈N, denote
by un the solution of Problem Pn. Then un →u in X, as n →∞, where u is the solution
of Problem P.
Proof. The proof of Theorem 4 is carried out in several steps.
i) A ﬁrst weak convergence result. We claim that there is an element eu ∈eK and a subse-
quence of {un}, still denoted by {un}, such that un ⇀eu in X, as n →∞.
6

To prove the claim, we establish the boundedness of the sequence {un} in X. Let n ∈N.
We use assumption (3.9) and take v = u in (3.2) to see that
(Aun, un −u)X ≤1
λn
(Gun, u −un)X + j(un, u) −j(un, un) + (fn, πun −πu)Y .
Then, using the strong monotonicity of the operator A we obtain that
m ∥un −u∥2
X ≤(Au, u −un)X + 1
λn
(Gun, u −un)X
(3.11)
+j(un, u) −j(un, un) + (fn, πun −πu)Y .
Next, assumption (3.10)(a) implies that
(Gun, u −un)X ≤0,
(3.12)
and assumptions (2.3), (2.10) yield
j(un, u) −j(un, un)
(3.13)
=
 j(un, u) −j(un, un) + j(u, un) −j(u, u)

+
 j(u, u) −j(u, un))
≤α∥un −u∥2
X + (β + γ∥u∥X)∥un −u∥X.
On the other hand, using (2.6) we ﬁnd that
(Au, u −un)X + (fn, πun −πu)Y ≤
 ∥Au∥X + c0∥fn∥Y

∥un −u∥X.
(3.14)
We now combine inequalities (3.11)–(3.14) to see that
m ∥un −u∥2
X ≤(∥Au∥X + c0∥fn∥Y

∥un −u∥X
(3.15)
+α∥un −u∥2
X + (β + γ∥u∥X)∥un −u∥X.
Note that by (3.8) we know that the sequence {fn} is bounded in Y . Therefore, using
inequality (3.15) and the smallness assumption (2.4), we deduce that there exists a constant
C > 0 independent of n such that ∥un −u∥X ≤C. This implies that the sequence {un} is
bounded in X. Thus, from the reﬂexivity of X, by passing to a subsequence, if necessary,
we deduce that
un ⇀eu in X,
as n →∞,
(3.16)
with some eu ∈X. Moreover, assumption (3.3) and the convergence (3.16) implies that
eu ∈eK and completes the proof of the claim.
ii) A property of the weak limit. Next, we show that eu is a solution to Problem P.
Let v be a given element in eK and let n ∈N. We use (3.2) to obtain that
1
λn
(Gun, un −v)X ≤(Aun, v −un)X
(3.17)
+j(un, v) −j(un, un) + (fn, πun −πv)Y .
7

Then, by conditions (2.2), (3.8), (2.10), (2.6), using the boundedness of the sequence {un},
we deduce that each term in the right hand side of inequality (3.17) is bounded. This
implies that there exists a constant D > 0 which does not depend on n such that
(Gun, un −v)X ≤λnD.
We now pass to the upper limit in this inequality and use the convergence (3.7) to deduce
that
lim sup (Gun, un −v)X ≤0.
(3.18)
Next, we take v = eu in (3.18) and ﬁnd that
lim sup (Gun, un −eu)X ≤0.
(3.19)
Therefore, using assumption (3.4) and a standard pseudomonotonicity argument (Proposi-
tion 1.23 in [30]) we obtain that
lim inf (Gun, un −v)X ≥(Geu, eu −v)X
∀v ∈X.
(3.20)
We now combine inequalities (3.20) and (3.18) to ﬁnd that (Geu, eu −v)X ≤0 for all v ∈eK.
Using now assumption (3.10)(b) we deduce that eu ∈K.
Consider now an element v ∈K. We use (3.9) and (3.2) to obtain that
(Aun, un −v)X ≤1
λn
(Gun, v −un)X
+j(un, v) −j(un, un) + (fn, πun −πv)Y .
Therefore, using assumption (3.10)(a) we ﬁnd that
(Aun, un −v)X ≤j(un, v) −j(un, un) + (fn, πun −πv)Y .
(3.21)
Next, using (3.16) and assumption (2.12) we have
lim sup
 j(un, v) −j(un, un)

≤j(eu, v) −j(eu, eu).
(3.22)
On the othe hand, assumption (3.8), (2.13) and the convergence (3.16) yield
(fn, πun −v)X →(f, πeu −πv)Y .
(3.23)
We now use relations (3.21)–(3.23) to see that
lim sup (Aun, un −v)X ≤j(eu, v) −j(eu, eu) + (f, πeu −πv)X.
(3.24)
Now, taking v = eu ∈K in (3.24) we obtain that
lim sup (Aun, un −eu)X ≤0.
(3.25)
This inequality together with (3.16) and the pseudomonotonicity of A implies that
(Aeu, eu −v)X ≤lim inf (Aun, un −v)X
∀v ∈X.
(3.26)
8

Combining now (3.26) and (3.24), we have
(Aeu, eu −v)X ≤j(eu, v) −j(eu, eu) + (f, πeu −πv)Y
for all v ∈K. Hence, it follows that eu ∈K is a solution to Problem P, as claimed.
iii) A second weak convergence result. We now prove the weak convergence of the whole
sequence {un}.
Since Problem P has a unique solution u ∈K, we deduce from the previous step that
eu = u. Moreover, a careful analysis of the proof in step ii) reveals that every subsequence
of {un} which converges weakly in X has the weak limit u. In addition, we recall that the
sequence {un} is bounded in X. Therefore, using a standard argument we deduce that the
whole sequence {un} converges weakly in X to u, as n →∞.
iv) Strong convergence.
In the ﬁnal step of the proof, we prove that un →u in X, as
n →∞.
We take v = eu ∈K in (3.26) and use (3.25) to obtain
0 ≤lim inf (Aun, un −eu)X ≤lim sup (Aun, un −eu)X ≤0,
which shows that (Aun, un −eu)X →0, as n →∞. Therefore, using equality eu = u, the
strong monotonicity of A and the convergence un ⇀u in X, we have
mA∥un −u∥2
X ≤(Aun −Au, un −u)X = (Aun, un −u)X −(Au, un −u)X →0,
as n →∞. Hence, it follows that un →u in X, which completes the proof.

Convergence of optimal pairs
In this section we associate to Problem Pn an optimal control problem for which we prove
a convergence result. To this end we keep the notation and assumptions in the previous
section and we deﬁne the set of admissible pairs for Problem Pn by
Vn
ad = { (un, fn) ∈eK × Y such that (3.2) holds }.
(4.1)
Then, the optimal control problem associated to Problem Pn is the following.
Problem Qn. Find (u∗
n, f ∗
n) ∈Vn
ad such that
Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) =
min
(un,fn)∈Vn
ad
Ln(un, fn).
(4.2)
In the study of Problem Qn we assume that
Ln(u, f) = gn(u) + hn(f)
∀u ∈X, f ∈Y,
(4.3)
where gn and hn are functions which satisfy assumptions (2.8) and (2.9), respectively, for
each n ∈N. Note than when we use these assumptions for the functions gn and hn we
refer to them as assumption (2.8)n and (2.9)n, respectively. Using Theorem 2 we have the
following existence result.
9

Proposition 5 Assume that (2.2)–(2.4), (2.6), (4.3), (2.8)n, (2.9)n, (2.10)–(2.13) and
(3.3)–(3.6) hold. Then, for each n ∈N, there exists at least one solution (u∗
n, f ∗
n) ∈Vn
ad
of Problem Qn.
To study the behavior of the sequence of solutions of Problems Qn as n →∞we
consider the following additional hypotheses.
un →u
in
X
=⇒
gn(un) →g(u).
(4.4)
fn ⇀f
in
Y
=⇒
lim inf hn(fn) ≥h(f).
(4.5)
∥fn∥Y →∞
=⇒
hn(fn) →∞.
(4.6)
hn(f) →h(f)
∀f ∈Y.
(4.7)
Our main result in this section is the following.
Theorem 6 Assume that (2.1)–(2.4), (2.6)–(2.13), (3.3)–(3.7), (3.9), (3.10), (2.8)n (2.9)n,
(4.3)–(4.7) hold and, moreover, assume that {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)} is a sequence of solutions of Problem
Qn. Then, there exists a subsequence of the sequence {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)}, again denoted by {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)},
and an element (u∗, f ∗) ∈X × Y such that
f ∗
n ⇀f ∗
in
Y
as
n →∞,
(4.8)
u∗
n →u∗
in
X
as
n →∞,
(4.9)
(u∗, f ∗)
is a solution of Problem Q.
(4.10)
Proof. The proof is carried out in several steps, as follows.
i) A boundedness result. We claim that the sequence {f ∗
n} is bounded in Y .
Arguing by contradiction, assume that {f ∗
n} is not bounded in Y . Then, passing to a
subsequence still denoted {f ∗
n}, we have
∥f ∗
n∥Y →+∞
as
n →+∞.
(4.11)
We use equality (4.3) and assumption (2.8)n(b) to see that
Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ≥hn(f ∗
n).
Therefore, passing to the limit as n →∞in this inequality and using (4.11) combined with
assumption (4.6) we deduce that
lim Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) = +∞.
(4.12)
On the other hand, since (u∗
n, f ∗
n) represents a solution to Problem Qn, for each n ∈N
we have
Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ≤Ln(un, fn)
∀(un, fn) ∈Vn
ad.
(4.13)
We now denote by u0
n the solution of Problem Pn for fn = f. Then (u0
n, f) ∈Vn
ad and,
therefore, (4.13) and (4.3) imply that
Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ≤gn(u0
n) + hn(f).
(4.14)
10

Note that the convergences (3.7) and (3.8) allows us to apply Theorem 4 in order to see
that
u0
n →u
in
X
as
n →∞
(4.15)
where, recall, u represents the solution of Problem P. Then, assumptions (4.4) and (4.7)
imply that
gn(u0
n) + hn(f) →g(u) + h(f).
(4.16)
Relations (4.12), (4.14 ) and (4.16) lead to a contradiction, which concludes the claim.
ii) Two convergence results. In this step we prove the convergences (4.8) and (4.9).
First, since the sequence {f ∗
n} is bounded in Y we can ﬁnd a subsequence again denoted
by {f ∗
n} and an element f ∗∈Y such that (4.8) holds. Next, we denote by u∗the solution
of Problem P for f = f ∗. Then, we have
(u∗, f ∗) ∈Vad.
(4.17)
Moreover, assumption (3.7), the convergence (4.8) and Theorem 4 imply that (4.9) holds,
too.
iii) Optimality of the limit. We now prove that (u∗, f ∗) is a solution to the optimal control
problem Q.
We use the convergences (4.8), (4.9) and assumptions (4.4), (4.5), to see that
lim inf
 gn(u∗
n) + hn(f ∗
n)

≥g(u∗) + h(f ∗)
and, therefore, the structure (4.3) and (2.7) of the functionals Ln and L shows that
L(u∗, f ∗) ≤lim inf Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n).
(4.18)
Next, we ﬁx a solution (u∗
0, f ∗
0) of Problem Q and, in addition, for each n ∈N we denote
by eu0
n the solution of Problem Pn for fn = f ∗
0 . It follows from here that (eu0
n, f ∗
0) ∈Vn
ad and,
by the optimality of the pair (u∗
n, f ∗
n), we have that
Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ≤Ln(eu0
n, f ∗
0)
∀n ∈N.
We pass to the upper limit in this inequality to see that
lim sup Ln(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ≤lim sup Ln(eu0
n, f ∗
0).
(4.19)
Now, remember that u∗
0 is the solution of the inequality (1.1) for f = f ∗
0 and eu0
n is the
solution of the inequality (3.2) for fn = f ∗
0. Therefore, the convergence (3.7) and Theorem
4 imply that
eu0
n →u∗
0
in
X
as
n →∞
and, using assumptions (4.4) and (4.7), we ﬁnd that
gn(eu0
n) →g(u∗
0),
hn(f ∗
0) →h(f ∗
0)
as
n →∞.
(4.20)
We now use (4.3), (4.20) and (2.7) to deduce that
lim Ln(eu0
n, f ∗
0) = L(u∗
0, f ∗
0).
(4.21)
11

Therefore, (4.18), (4.19) and (4.21) imply that
L(u∗, f ∗) ≤L(u∗
0, f ∗
0).
(4.22)
On the other hand, since (u∗
0, f ∗
0) is a solution of Problem Q, we have
L(u∗
0, f ∗
0) =
min
(u,f)∈Vad L(u, f).
(4.23)
and, therefore, inclusion (4.17) implies that
L(u∗
0, f ∗
0) ≤L(u∗, f ∗).
(4.24)
We now combine the inequalities (4.22) and (4.24) to see that
L(u∗, f ∗) = L(u∗
0, f ∗
0).
(4.25)
Finally, relations (4.17), (4.25) and (4.23) imply that (4.10) holds, which completes the
proof of the Theorem.

A frictional contact problem
The abstract results in Sections 2–4 are useful in the study of various mathematical models
which describe the equilibrium of elastic bodies in frictional contact with a foundation. In
this section we provide an example of such model and, to this end, we need some notations
and preliminaries.
Let d ∈{2, 3}. We denote by Sd the space of second order symmetric tensors on Rd and
use the notation “ · ”, ∥· ∥, 0 for the inner product, the norm and the zero element of the
spaces Rd and Sd, respectively. Let Ω⊂Rd be a domain with smooth boundary ∂Ωdivided
into three measurable disjoint parts Γ1, Γ2 and Γ3 such that meas (Γ1) > 0. A generic
point in Ω∪Γ will be denoted by x = (xi). We use the standard notation for Sobolev and
Lebesgue spaces associated to Ωand Γ. In particular, we use the spaces L2(Ω)d, L2(Γ2)d,
L2(Γ3) and H1(Ω)d, endowed with their canonical inner products and associated norms.
Moreover, for an element v ∈H1(Ω)d we still write v for the trace of v to Γ. In addition,
we consider the space
V = { v ∈H1(Ω)d : v = 0 on Γ1 },
which is a real Hilbert space endowed with the canonical inner product
(u, v)V =
Z
Ω
ε(u) · ε(v) dx
(5.1)
and the associated norm ∥· ∥V . Here and below ε represents the deformation operator, i.e.,
ε(u) = (εij(u)),
εij(u) = 1
2 (ui,j + uj,i),
where an index that follows a comma denotes the partial derivative with respect to the
corresponding component of x, e.g., ui,j = ∂ui
∂j . The completeness of the space V follows
from the assumption meas (Γ1) > 0 which allows us to use Korn’s inequality. We denote
12

by 0V the zero element of V and we recall that, for an element v ∈V , the normal and
tangential components on Γ are given by vν = v · ν and vτ = v −vνν, respectively. We
also recall the trace inequality
∥v∥L2(Γ)d ≤d0∥v∥V
∀v ∈V
(5.2)
in which d0 represents a positive constant.
For the inequality problem we consider in this section we use the data F, p, f 0, f 2, µ
and k which satisfy the following conditions.

(5.7)

(5.8)
Moreover, we use Y for the product space L2(Ω)d × L2(Γ3)d equipped with the canonical
inner product, and K for the set deﬁned by
K = { v ∈V
: vν ≤k a.e. on Γ3 }.
(5.9)
Then, the inequality problem we consider in this section is the following.
Problem Pc. Find u such that

Following the arguments in [30, 31], it can be shown that Problem Pc represents the
variational formulation of a mathematical model that describes the equilibrium of an elastic
body Ωwhich is acted upon by external forces, is ﬁxed on Γ1, and is in frictional contact
on Γ3. The contact takes place with a rigid foundation covered by a layer of deformable
13

material of thickness k. In (5.10) and below we shall refer to this foundation as foundation
Fk. Here F is the elasticity operator, f 0 and f 2 denote the density of applied body forces
and tractions which act on the body and the surface Γ2, respectively, p is a given function
which describes the reaction of the deformable material and µ represents the coeﬃcient of
friction.
Next, we consider the constants a0, a2, a3 and a function θ such that
a0 > 0,
a2 > 0,
a3 > 0,
θ ∈L2(Γ3).
(5.11)
We associate to Problem Pc the set of admissible pairs Vc
ad and the cost functional L given
by

L(u∗, f ∗) =

(5.15)
ek ≥k > 0.
(5.16)
We introduce the set
eK = { v ∈V

(5.17)
and we assume that for each n ∈N the functions f 0n, f 2n, θn and the constant λn are
given and satisfy the following conditions:
f 0n ∈L2(Ω)d,
f 2n ∈L2(Γ3)d,
(5.18)
λn > 0,
θn ∈L2(Γ3).
(5.19)
Then, for each n ∈N, we consider the following perturbation of Problem Pc.

Following [30, 31], Problem Pc
n represents the variational formulation of the contact
problem with a foundation made of a rigid body covered by a layer of deformable material
of thickness ek. This layer is divided into two parts: a ﬁrst layer of thickness ek −k > 0
located on the top of the rigid body, and a second layer of thickness k, located above. Here,
λn is the deformability coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst layer and, therefore,
1
λn represents its stiﬀness
coeﬃcient. In addition, q is a given normal compliance function which describes the reaction
of this ﬁrst layer. We shall refer to this foundation as foundation Fek. A short comparation
between the variational inequalities (5.10) and (5.20) reveals the fact that replacing the
foundation Fk with foundation Fek give rise to an extra term in the corresponding variational
formulation, governed by the stiﬀness coeﬃcient

λn .
We associate to Problem Pc
n the set of admissible pairs Vcn

given by

in [28], is the following.
Theorem 7 Assume that (5.3)–(5.8), (5.11), (5.15), (5.16), (5.18) and (5.19) hold. Then:
a) Problem Pc has a unique solution and, for each n ∈N, Problem Pc
n has a unique
solution. Moreover, if
λn →0,
f 0n ⇀f 0 in L2(Ω),
f 2n ⇀f 2 in L2(Γ3)

(5.23)
the solution of Problem Pc
n converges to the solution of Problem Pc, i.e.,

(5.24)
b) Problem Qc has at least one solution and, for each n ∈N, Problem Qc

θn →θ in L2(Γ3)

(5.25)
and {(u∗

n, there exists a subsequence of the
sequence {(u∗

such that

Proof. We start with some additional notation. First, we denote by π : V →Y the operator
v 7→(ιv, γ2v) where ι : V →L2(Ω)d is the canonic embedding and γ2 : V →L2(Γ2)d is the
restriction to the trace map to Γ2. Next, we consider the operators A : V →V , G : V →V ,
the function j : V × V →IR and the element f ∈Y deﬁned as follows:
(Au, v)V =
Z
Ω
Fε(u) · ε(v) dx +

j(u, v) = µ
Z
Γ3
p(uν)∥vτ∥da,
(5.29)
f = (f 0, f 2),
(5.30)
for all u, v ∈V . Then it is easy to see that
(
u is a solution of Problem Pc if and only if
u ∈K,
(Au, v −u)V + j(u, v) −j(u, u) ≥(f, πv −πu)Y
∀v ∈K.
(5.31)
Moreover, for each n ∈N,





un is a solution of Problem Pc
n if and only if
un ∈eK,
(Aun, v −un)V +
1
λn (Gun, v −un)V + j(un, v) −j(un, un)
≥(f n, v −u)Y
∀v ∈eK.
(5.32)
We now proceed with the proof of the two parts of the theorem.
a) We use the abstract results in Sections 2 and 3 with X = V , Y = L2(Ω)d×L2(Γ2)d, K
and eK deﬁned by (5.9) and (5.17), respectively, A deﬁned by (5.27), G deﬁned by (5.28),
j deﬁned by (5.29) and f given by (5.30). It is easy to see that in this case conditions
(2.1)–(2.6), (3.3)–(3.10) are satisﬁed.
For instance, using assumption (5.3) we see that
(Au −Av, u −v)V ≥mF∥u −v∥2
V ,
∥Au −Av∥V ≤(LF + d2
0Lp) ∥u −v∥V
for all u, v ∈V . Therefore, condition (2.2) holds with m = mF. Condition (2.3)(a) is
obviously satisﬁed and, on the other hand, an elementary calculation based on the deﬁnition
(5.29) and the trace inequality (5.2) shows that
j(u1, v2) −j(u1, v1) + j(u2, v1) −j(u2, v2) ≤d2
0µLp ∥u1 −u2∥V ∥v1 −v2∥V
for all u1, u2, v1, v2 ∈V . Therefore, condition (2.3)(b) holds with α = d2
0µLp. Next, con-
dition (2.10) holds with β = 0 and γ = d2
0µLp and, using (5.7) it follows that the smallness
conditions (2.4) and (2.11), too. We also note that conditions (2.12), and (2.13) arise from
standard compactness arguments and, ﬁnally, condition (3.10) is a direct consequence of
the deﬁnitions (5.28), (5.17) and (5.9), combined with the properties (5.15) of the function
q.
16

Therefore, we are in a position to apply Theorem 1 and Proposition 3 in order to
deduce the existence of a unique solution of the variational inequalities in (5.31) and (5.32),
respectively. Moreover, if (5.23) holds, by Theorem 4 we deduce the convergence (5.24).
These results combined with (5.31) and (5.32) allows us to conclude the proof of the ﬁrst
part of the theorem.
b) Next, we use the abstract results in Sections 2 and 4 in the functional framework
already described above, with the functionals L and Ln given by (5.13) and (5.22), respec-
tively. It is easy to see that in this case conditions (2.1)–(2.4), (2.6)–(2.13), (3.3)–(3.6),
(2.8)n (2.9)n, (4.3)–(4.7) hold, with an appropriate choice of the functions g, h, gn and hn.
Therefore, we are in a position to apply Proposition 5 in order to deduce the existence of
a solution of the optimal control problems in Qc and Qc
n, and Theorem 6 in order to prove
the convergence (5.26), as well.
□
We now end this section with the following mechanical interpretation of Theorem 7.
i) The convergence result (5.24) shows that the solution of the frictional contact with
foundation Fk can be approximated by the solution of the frictional contact problem with
foundation Fek, with a large stiﬀness coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst layer of the deformable material.
In other words, if this layer is almost rigid, then the solution of the corresponding contact
problem is close to the solution of the contact problem in which this layer is perfectly rigid.
ii) The mechanical interpretation of the optimal control Problem Qc is the following:
given a contact process governed by the variational inequality (5.10) with the data F, p,
k and µ which satisfy condition (5.3), (5.4), (5.6), (5.7) and (5.8), we are looking for a
couple of applied forces (f 0, f 2) ∈L2(Ω)d × L2(Γ2)d such that the normal displacement
of the solution on the contact surface is as close as possible to the “desired” displacement
θ. Furthermore, this choice has to fulﬁll a minimum expenditure condition. Theorem 7
guarantees the existence of at least one optimal couple of applied forces (f ∗
0, f ∗
2). A similar
comment can be made on the optimal control Problem Qc
n. Finally, the optimal solutions of
the contact problem associated to foundation Fek converge (in the sense given by Theorem 7
c)) to an optimal solution of the contact problem associated foundation Fk, as the stiﬀness
coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst deformable layer goes to inﬁnity.

A heat transfer boundary value problem
In this section we apply the abstract results in Sections 2–4 in the study of a mathematical
model which describes a heat transfer phenomenon. The problem we consider represents a
version of the problem already considered in [4] and, for this reason, we skip the details.
Its classical formulation is the following.
Problem Ct. Find a temperature ﬁeld u : Ω→IR such that
u ≥0,
∆u + f ≤0,
u(∆u + f) = 0
a.e. in Ω,
(6.1)
u = 0
a.e. on Γ1,
(6.2)
u = b
a.e. on Γ2,
(6.3)
−∂u
∂ν = q
a.e. on Γ3.
(6.4)
17

Here, as in Section 5, Ωis a bounded domain in Rd (d = 1, 2, 3 in applications) with
smooth boundary ∂Ω= Γ1 ∪Γ2 ∪Γ3 and outer normal unit ν. We assume that Γ1, Γ2, Γ3
are disjoint measurable sets and, moreover, meas (Γ1) > 0. In addition, in (6.1)–(6.4) we do
not mention the dependence of the diﬀerent functions on the spatial variable x ∈Ω∪∂Ω.
The functions f, b and q are given and will be described below. Here we mention that f
represents the internal energy, b is the prescribed temperature ﬁeld on Γ2 and q represents
the heat ﬂux prescribed on Γ3. Moreover, ∂u
∂ν denotes the normal derivative of u on Γ3.
For the variational analysis of Problem Ct we consider the space
V = { v ∈H1(Ω) : v = 0
on
Γ1}.
We denote in what follows by (·, ·)V the inner product of the space H1(Ω) restricted to V
and by ∥· ∥V the associated norm. Since meas (Γ1) > 0, it is well known that (V, (·, ·)V ) is
a real Hilbert space. Next, we assume that
f ∈L2(Ω),
b ∈L2(Γ2),
q ∈L2(Γ3),
(6.5)
there exists v0 ∈V such that v0 ≥0 in Ωand v0 = b on Γ2
(6.6)
and, ﬁnally, we introduce the set
K = { v ∈V
: v ≥0 in Ω,
v = b on Γ2 }.
(6.7)
Note that assumption (6.6) represents a compatibility assumption on the data b which guar-
antees that the set K is not empty. Then, it is easy to see that the variational formulation
of problem Ct, obtained by standard arguments, is as follows.
Problem Pt. Find u such that
u ∈K,
Z

∇u · (∇v −∇u) dx +
Z
Γ3
q(v −u) da ≥
Z

f(v −u) dx
∀v ∈K.
(6.8)
We now introduce the set of admissible pairs for inequality (6.8) deﬁned by
Vt
ad = { (u, f) ∈K × L2(Ω) such that (6.8) holds }.
(6.9)
Moreover, we consider two constants ω, δ and a function φ such that
ω > 0,
δ > 0,
φ ∈L2(Ω)
(6.10)
and, with these data, we associate to Problem Pt the following optimal control problem.
Problem Qt. Find (u∗, f ∗) ∈Vt
ad such that
ω

.
(6.11)
Next, we introduce the set
eK = { v ∈V
: v ≥0 in Ω}
(6.12)
18

and we assume that for each n ∈N the functions fn, φn and the constants λn, ωn, δn, are
given and satisfy the following conditions:
fn ∈L2(Ω),
(6.13)
λn > 0,
ωn > 0,
δn > 0,
φn ∈L2(Ω).
(6.14)
Then, for each n ∈N, we consider the following perturbation of Problem Pt.
Problem Pt
n. Find un such that
un ∈eK,
Z

(6.15)
+ 1
λn
Z
Γ2
(un −b)(v −un) da ≥
Z
Ω

∀v ∈eK.
Using standard arguments it is easy to see that Problem Pt
n represents the variational
formulation of the following boundary value problem.
Problem Ct
n. Find a temperature ﬁeld un : Ω→IR such that
un ≥0,
∆un + fn ≤0,
un(∆un + fn) = 0
a.e. in Ω,
(6.16)
un = 0
a.e. on Γ1,
(6.17)
−∂un
∂ν = 1
λn
(un −b)
a.e. on Γ2,
(6.18)
−∂un
∂ν = q
a.e. on Γ3.
(6.19)
Note that Problem Ct
n is obtained from Problem Ct by replacing the Dirichlet boundary
condition (6.3) with the Neumann boundary condition (6.18) and prescribing the internal
energy fn in Ω, instead of the internal energy f. Here λn is a positive parameter, and its
inverse hn =
1
λn represents the heat transfer coeﬃcient on the boundary Γ2. In contrast to
Problem Pt (in which the temperature is prescribed on Γ2), in Problem Pt
n this condition is
replaced by a condition on the ﬂux of the temperature, governed by a positive heat transfer
coeﬃcient.
The set of admissible pairs for inequality (6.15) is deﬁned by
Vtn
ad = { (un, fn) ∈eK × L2(Ω) such that (6.15) holds }
(6.20)
and, moreover, the associated optimal control problem is the following.
Problem Qt

Theorem 8 Assume that (6.5)–(6.6), (6.10), (6.13) and (6.14) hold. Then:
a) Problem Pt has a unique solution and, for each n ∈N, Problem Pt
n has a unique

λn →0

fn ⇀f

(6.22)
the solution of Problem Pt
n converges to the solution of Problem Pt, i.e.,

b) Problem Qt has at least one solution and, for each n ∈N, Problem Qt
n has at least

ωn →ω,
δn →δ,
φn →φ in L2(Ω)
as n →∞
(6.24)
and let {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)} be a sequence of solutions of Problem Qt
n. Then, there exists a subsequence
of the sequence {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)}, again denoted by {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)}, and a solution (u∗, f ∗) of Problem
Qt, such that
f ∗
n ⇀f ∗
in
L2(Ω),
u∗
n →u∗
in
V
as
n →∞.
(6.25)
Moreover, if φ = 0L2(Ω), then the whole sequence {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)} satisﬁes (6.25) where (u∗, f ∗)
represents the unique solution of Problem Qt.
Proof. We start by introducing some notation which allow us to write the problems in an
equivalent form. To this end, we denote by π : V →L2(Ω) the canonical inclusion of V in
L2(Ω). Moreover, we consider the operators A : V →V , G : V →V deﬁned as follows:
(Au, v)V =
Z
Ω
∇u · ∇v dx +
Z
Γ3
qv da
∀u, v ∈V,
(6.26)
(Gu, v)V =
Z
Γ2
(u −b)v da
∀u, v ∈V.
(6.27)
Then, it is easy to see that
(
u is a solution of Problem Pt if and only if
u ∈K,
(Au, v −u)V ≥(f, v −u)L2(Ω)
∀v ∈K.
(6.28)
Moreover, for each n ∈N,





un is a solution of Problem Pt
n if and only if
un ∈eK,
(Au, v −u)V +
1
λn(Gun, v −un)V
≥(fn, v −un)L2(Ω)
∀v ∈eK.
(6.29)
Next, denote by L : V × L2(Ω) →IR and Ln : V × L2(Ω) →IR the cost functionals
given by
L(u, f) = ω∥u −φ∥2
L2(Ω) + δ∥f∥2
L2(Ω) ,
(6.30)
Ln(u, f) = ωn∥u −φn∥2
L2(Ω) + δn∥f∥2
L2(Ω)
(6.31)
20

for all (u, f) ∈V × L2(Ω). Then, it is easy to see that



(u∗, f ∗) is a solution of Problem Qt if and only if
(u∗, f ∗) ∈Vt
ad
and
L(u∗, f ∗) =
min
(u∗f∗)∈V
t
ad
L(u, f)
(6.32)
Moreover, for each n ∈N,



(u∗

n) is a solution of Problem Qt if and only if
(u∗
n, f ∗
n) ∈Vtn
ad
and
Ln(u∗

n) =
min
(u∗f∗)∈V

(6.33)
We now proceed with the proof of the two parts of the theorem.
a) We use the abstract results in Sections 2 and 3 with X = V , Y = L2(Ω), K and eK
deﬁned by (6.7) and (6.12), respectively, A deﬁned by (6.26), G deﬁned by (6.27), and j ≡0.
It is easy to see that in this case conditions (2.1)–(2.6), (3.3)–(3.10) are satisﬁed. Therefore,
we are in a position to apply Theorem 1 and Proposition 3 in order to deduce the existence of
a unique solution of the variational inequalities in (6.28) and (6.29), respectively. Moreover,
by Theorem 4 we deduce the convergence (6.23). These results combined with (6.28) and
(6.29) allows us to conclude the proof of the statement a) in Theorem 8.
b) We use the abstract results in Sections 2 and 4 in the functional framework described
above, with the functionals L and Ln given by (6.30) and (6.31), respectively. It is easy to
see that in this case conditions (2.1)–(2.4), (2.6)–(2.13), (3.3)–(3.6), (2.8)n (2.9)n, (4.3) and
(4.4)–(4.5) hold, with an appropriate choice of the functions g, h, gn and hn. Therefore, we
are in a position to apply Theorem 2 and Proposition 5 in order to deduce the existence of
a solution of the optimal control problems in (6.32) and (6.33), respectively.
The uniqueness of the solution of Problem Qt in the case φ = 0L2(Ω) follows from a
strict convexity argument. Indeed, for any f ∈L2(Ω) let u(f) denote the solution of the
variational inequality in (6.28). Then it was proved in [4] that the functional
f 7→L(u(f), f) = ω∥u(f)∥2
L2(Ω) + δ∥f∥2
L2(Ω)
is strictly convex and, therefore, the optimal control problem in (6.32) has a unique solution.
The uniqueness of the solution of Problem Qt
n in the case φn = 0L2(Ω) follows from the same
argument. These results combined with the equivalence results (6.32) and (6.33) allows us
to conclude the proof of the statement b) in Theorem 8.
c) The convergence (6.25) is a direct consequence of Theorem 6. The convergence (6.25)
of the whole sequence {(u∗
n, f ∗
n)} in the case φ = 0L2(Ω) follows from a standard argument,
since in this case Problem Qt has a unique solution.
□
We end this section with the following physical interpretation of Theorem 8.
i) First, the solutions of Problems Pt and Pt
n represent weak solutions of the the heat
transfer problems Ct and Ct
n, respectively. Therefore, Theorem 8 provides the unique weak
solvability of these problems. Moreover, the weak solution of the problem with prescribed
temperature on Γ2 can be approximated by the solution of the problem with heat transfer
on Γ2, for a large heat transfer coeﬃcient, as shown in [33].
ii) The physical interpretation of the optimal control Problem Qt is the following: given
a heat transfer process governed by the variational inequality (6.8) with the data b and q
21

which satisfy condition (6.5) and (6.6), we are looking for an internal energy f ∗∈L2(Ω) such
that the temperature u is as close as possible to the “desired” temperature φ. Furthermore,
this choice has to fulﬁll a minimum expenditure condition which is taken into account by
the last term in the cost functional. In fact, a compromise policy between the two aims (“u
close to φ” and “minimal energy f”) has to be found and the relative importance of each
criterion with respect to the other is expressed by the choice of the weight coeﬃcients ω
and δ. Theorem 8 guarantees the existence of at least one optimal energy function f ∗and,
if the target φ vanishes, the optimal energy is unique. A similar comment can be made on
the optimal control Problem Qt
n. Finally, the optimal solutions of the heat transfer problem
converge (in the sens given by Theorem 8 c)) to an optimal solution of the thermal problem
with prescribed temperature on Γ2, as the heat transfer coeﬃcient converges to inﬁnity.
