Abstract The global minimum-variance portfolio is a typical choice for in-
vestors because of its simplicity and broad applicability. Although it requires
only one input, namely the covariance matrix of asset returns, estimating the
optimal solution remains a challenge. In the presence of high-dimensionality in
the data, the sample covariance estimator becomes ill-conditioned and leads to
suboptimal portfolios out-of-sample. To address this issue, we review recently
proposed eﬃcient estimation methods for the covariance matrix and extend
the literature by suggesting a multi-fold cross-validation technique for selecting
the necessary tuning parameters within each method. Conducting an exten-
sive empirical analysis with four datasets based on the S&P 500, we show that
the data-driven choice of speciﬁc tuning parameters with the proposed cross-
validation improves the out-of-sample performance of the global minimum-
variance portfolio. In addition, we identify estimators that are strongly inﬂu-
enced by the choice of the tuning parameter and detect a clear relationship
between the selection criterion within the cross-validation and the evaluated
performance measure.

1 Introduction
Based on the simple but essential idea of diversiﬁcation and optimal risk-return
proﬁle of an investment strategy, the mean-variance model by Markowitz
(1952) still represents the groundwork for portfolio optimization. In its original
design, Markowitz portfolio theory assumes perfect knowledge about the ex-
pected value and variance of returns. For practical implementations, however,
these parameters have to be estimated from historical data. The misspeciﬁca-
tions due to error in estimation can lead to strong deviations from optimality
and therefore an inferior out-of-sample performance (Jobson and Korkie 1981;
Frost and Savarino 1986; Michaud 1989; Broadie 1993). This major drawback
has been tackled from diﬀerent perspectives in the ﬁnancial literature. Some
focus on estimation errors in the portfolio weights directly (see, e.g., Brodie
et al. 2009; DeMiguel et al. 2009a), whereas others work on the inputs by
improving expected returns and the covariance matrix.
In particular, portfolio weights are extremely sensitive to changes in ex-
pected returns (Best and Grauer 1991b,a), which in turn are more diﬃcult
to estimate than the covariances of returns (Merton 1980). It is therefore not
surprising that a considerable part of recent academic research focuses on the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMV), as this does not depend on ex-
pected returns.1 However, even if investors decide to use the global minimum-
variance portfolio, the estimation errors associated with the covariances can
still lead to signiﬁcant estimation errors in the portfolio weights, especially in
a high-dimensional scenario.
We cover several approaches that have been shown to overcome these es-
timation issues and perform well in terms of out-of-sample variance. For in-
stance, we discuss the linear shrinkage estimators of Ledoit and Wolf (2004a,b)
designed to oﬀer an optimal bias-variance trade-oﬀbetween the sample covari-
ance matrix and a structured target matrix. Furthermore, we adopt the recent
nonlinear shrinkage technique by Ledoit and Wolf (2017) that is proven to be
optimal under a variety of ﬁnancially relevant loss functions (Ledoit and Wolf
2018b). Since an underlying factor structure is considered a valid assumption
for asset returns’ covariance estimators, we outline the elaborate principal or-
thogonal complement thresholding (POET) estimator by Fan et al. (2013). In
addition, we follow the ﬁndings of the recent empirical studies by Goto and
Xu (2015) and Torri et al. (2019) and include a sparse precision matrix esti-
mator, namely the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(GLASSO), which has so far received little attention in portfolio optimization
research. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to compare state-of-
the-art covariance estimators such as the nonlinear shrinkage and POET with
the GLASSO and to prove its signiﬁcant outperformance in a high-dimensional
scenario.
1 DeMiguel et al. (2009b) additionally show that the mean-variance portfolio is outper-
formed out-of-sample by the minimum-variance portfolio not only in terms of risk, but as
well in respect to the return-risk ratio.

More importantly, the selected covariance estimation methods share one
thing in common: a regularization of the sample covariance is performed to
optimize its out-of-sample performance. For example, linear shrinkage methods
need an optimal shrinkage intensity to balance the included variance and bias,
whereas the performance of the GLASSO depends on the level of sparsity,
induced by a penalty parameter. The procedure for optimally identifying those
tuning parameters often includes the choice of a speciﬁc loss function to be
minimized. As often advocated, a loss function or measure of ﬁt in the model
estimation is best aligned with the evaluation framework (Christoﬀersen and
Jacobs 2004; Ledoit and Wolf 2017; Engle et al. 2019). To exploit those eﬀects
in more detail, we apply a nonparametric cross-validation (CV) technique with
diﬀerent selection criteria to determine the optimal parameters, necessary for
the calculation of all the considered covariance estimators.
Since we focus on enhancing the risk proﬁle of the GMV portfolios, we
choose two relevant risk-related measures for our data-driven estimation method-
ology and the corresponding out-of-sample performance evaluation, namely
the mean squared forecasting error (MSFE), as in Zakamulin (2015), and the
out-of-sample portfolio variance. We show empirically that in most cases there
exists a strong positive relation between the selection criterion within the CV
and the respective out-of-sample performance measure. For instance, when the
overall goal is to reduce the out-of-sample risk, then using CV with the port-
folio variance as a measure of ﬁt leads to lower risk than the original method.
Similar results are documented by Liu (2014), although he only considers the
most straight-forward linear shrinkage as in Ledoit and Wolf (2003, 2004a,b).
Here, we examine more recent and eﬃcient estimation methods and identify
those that can actually proﬁt from a data-driven methodology. In detail, es-
timators that depend strongly on the choice of a speciﬁc tuning parameter
within their derivation are more prone to be positively inﬂuenced by replacing
the original solution with a data-driven one.
Our contributions to the current literature on the subject of covariance
and precision matrix estimation within the portfolio optimization framework
can be summarized as follows. First, we show that recent advances in methods
for high-dimensional covariance estimation lead to strong improvements in the
risk proﬁle of the GMV. In this context, we emphasize the distinct and often
signiﬁcant outperformance of the GLASSO, which estimates sparse precision
matrices by identifying pairs of zero partial auto-correlations in asset returns
data. In line with the main discussion, we show that a model’s outperformance
in respect to out-of-sample portfolio variance does coincide with an identical
objective within the CV. Although the elaborate method outlined in Ledoit
and Wolf (2017) is not strongly inﬂuenced by applying the CV procedure, all
the other considered data-driven estimators perform better than their original
counterparts. This advantage becomes even greater as the high-dimensionality
of the data increases. Considering the MSFE, the results are straightforward
for all estimation methods. If an investor aims to minimize this measure, the
respective data-driven estimation ought to be performed. Nonetheless, we an-
alyze the ineﬃciency of the MSFE for high-dimensional asset returns’ data,

in particular, because of a distorted calculation of the realized covariance ma-
trix. Finally, to test the robustness of our results, we examine the eﬀects of
the suggested methods on the GMV without short sales. As argued by Jagan-
nathan and Ma (2003), a constraint imposed on short sales is similar to the
linear shrinkage technique since it reduces the impact of estimation errors on
optimal portfolio weights. Nevertheless, we show that a CV with the portfolio
variance as a selection criterion slightly improves the out-of-sample risk even
in this scenario.
The rest of paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the con-
sidered covariance estimation methods and their properties. Section 3 outlines
the suggested data-driven methodology in respect to its main characteristics:
the cross-validation procedure, the parameter set, and the selection criteria.
We describe the empirical study in Section 4 with a strong focus on the cho-
sen dataset, methodology and performance measures. In Section 5, we discuss
the performance of classical and constrained GMV portfolios and analyze in
detail the inﬂuence of data-driven estimation among all considered datasets
and methods. Section 6 summarizes the results and concludes.
2 Overview of the Estimation Methods
2.1 Sample Covariance
The standard approach for estimating the covariance matrix of returns among
researchers and practitioners is to use the sample estimator, deﬁned as
bΣS =
1
T −1 (R −bµ1)′ (R −bµ1) ,
(1)
where R ∈RT ×n is the matrix of past asset returns with T observations and
n number of stocks, bµ ∈Rn is the vector of expected returns, here estimated
with the sample mean, and 1 is an n-dimensional vector of ones. As shown
by Merton (1980), the sample covariance matrix is an asymptotically unbi-
ased and consistent estimator of the true covariance matrix Σ in terms of the
Frobenius norm ||·||2 ´when the concentration ratio q = n/T →0. For a large
number of assets a concentration ratio of such magnitude is practically infeasi-
ble due to limited data availability and illiquidity issues. With a high relation
of the number of assets to the sample size, also called high-dimensionality, the
sample covariance and its inverse exhibit higher amount of estimation error,
mainly due to the over- and underestimation of the respective eigenvalues.
Moreover, for q > 1, the sample covariance becomes singular and the inverse
cannot be calculated.
The sample estimator’s instability and possible singularity in case of high-
dimensionality are a problem within the optimization of global minimum-
variance portfolios, where the covariance matrix and, speciﬁcally, its inverse
capture the dependency between asset returns and allow for the eﬀect of diver-
siﬁcation as a way of reducing risk. It is then straightforward that the accuracy

of optimally estimated portfolio weights is directly related to the estimator’s
precision. As a solution, several alternative estimators have been proposed in
the literature.
2.2 Linear Shrinkage
To produce more stable estimators of the covariance matrix, a linear shrinking
procedure can be applied to the sample estimator towards a more structured
target matrix bΣT,
bΣLS = s bΣT + (1 −s) bΣS ,
where the constant s ∈[0, 1] controls the shrinkage intensity, which is set higher
the more ill-conditioned the sample estimator is and vice versa. In contrast to
the unbiased, but unstable sample covariance, a structured target matrix has
little estimation error but tends to be biased. As a compromise, the convex
combination of both uses the bias-variance trade-oﬀby accepting more bias
in-sample in exchange for less variance out-of-sample. This idea is central to
the shrinkage methodology of Stein (1956) and James and Stein (1961). More
recently, Ledoit and Wolf (2004b) propose a set of asymptotically optimal
shrinkage estimators and specify the identity matrix as a generic target matrix
if no speciﬁc covariance structure is assumed. The respective linear shrinkage
estimator is calculated as
bΣLW1 = bs¯σIn + (1 −bs) bΣS ,
(2)
where ¯σ = 1
n
Pn
j=1 σjj is the average of all individual sample variances and bs is
an optimal shrinkage intensity parameter. However, in the context of ﬁnancial
time series, it is beneﬁcial to consider target matrices with reference to the
correlation structure of asset returns.
Ledoit and Wolf (2004a) consider identical pairwise correlations between all
n assets. The target matrix is therefore derived under the constant correlation
matrix model of Elton and Gruber (1973), so that bΣT = bΣCC. While the
variances are kept as their original sample values, the oﬀ-diagonal entries of the
target matrix are estimated by assuming a constant average sample correlation
¯ρ. This results in bΣCC,ij =
p
bσiibσjj ¯ρ. The corresponding estimator is deﬁned
as
bΣLWCC = bs bΣCC + (1 −bs) bΣS .
(3)
The level of the shrinkage bs in Equations (2) and (3) can be obtained analyt-
ically. In particular, as shown by Ledoit and Wolf (2004a,b), asymptotically
consistent estimators for the optimal linear shrinkage intensity are derived
under the quadratic loss function

The methodology behind this derivation can be applied to other shrinkage tar-
gets in a convex combination setting after an individually performed analysis
and mathematical adaptation. Our data-driven implementation, however, can
be implemented for any linear shrinkage without further modiﬁcations, since
we do not rely on the theoretically derived shrinkage intensity; instead, we
search for an optimal value using CV.
2.3 Nonlinear Shrinkage
The nonlinear shrinkage method, ﬁrst proposed by Ledoit and Wolf (2012),
shrinks covariance entries by increasing small (underestimated) sample eigen-
values and decreasing large (overestimated) ones in an individual fashion.
Without any assumption about the true covariance matrix, the positive-deﬁnite
rotationally equivariant2 nonlinear shrinkage is based on the spectral decom-
position of the sample covariance matrix and deﬁned as
bΣLWNL = V bΛNLV ′ ,
(6)
where V = [v1, . . . , vn] is the orthogonal matrix with the sample eigenvectors
vi as columns and bΛNL is the diagonal matrix of the sample eigenvalues λi,
shrunk as shown in Ledoit and Wolf (2012, 2015, 2017, 2018a). To ﬁnd the op-
timal nonlinear shrinkage to the eigenvalues, Ledoit and Wolf (2012) originally
minimize the MSE in ﬁnite samples. Under the considered large-dimensional
asymptotics from the ﬁeld of Random Matrix Theory the Frobenius loss con-
verges almost surely to a nonstochastic limit, guaranteeing the estimator’s
optimality.
Without going into further details, we examine the practical implementa-
tion of the nonlinear shrinkage, as demonstrated by Ledoit and Wolf (2018a).
The optimal solution is achieved using a nonparametric variable bandwidth
kernel estimation of the limiting spectral density of the sample eigenvalues
and its Hilbert transform. The speed at which the bandwidth vanishes in the
number of assets n can be set to −0.2 according to standard kernel density es-
timation theory (Silverman 1986) or −0.5 following the Arrow model of Ledoit
and Wolf (2018b). As a compromise between those two approaches, Ledoit and
Wolf (2018a) suggest the value of −0.35. Within the suggested data-driven
methodology, we aim to verify whether this exact choice of the kernel band-
width’s speed is crucial for the estimator’s eﬃciency and whether applying the
suggested CV technique can improve the out-of-sample performance.
2 This class of estimators was ﬁrst introduced by Stein (1986).

2.4 Approximate Factor Model
The previously outlined methods for improved high-dimensional covariance es-
timation do not assume any structural knowledge about the covariance matrix
and regularize only the sample eigenvalues λi. An underlying structure could
be established by regularizing the sample eigenvectors vi, for example if the
covariance matrix itself is assumed to be sparse (see, e.g., Bickel and Levina
2008; Cai and Liu 2011). Unfortunately, this is not appropriate for ﬁnancial
time series because of the presence of common factors (Fan et al. 2013). How-
ever, if there is only conditional sparsity, the covariance matrix of investment
returns can be estimated using factor models given by
bΣFM = B bΣFB′ + bΣu ,
where ΣF is the sample covariance matrix of the common factors and bΣu is
the residuals covariance matrix.3 One disadvantage of such exact factor mod-
els is the strong assumption of no correlation in the error terms across assets;
that is, the error covariance matrix bΣu is assumed to contain only the sam-
ple variances of the residuals. Therefore, possible cross-sectional correlations
are neglected after separating the common present factors (Fan et al. 2013).
Instead, approximate factor models allow for oﬀ-diagonal values within the
error covariance matrix. The POET estimator is one of the most recent and
eﬃcient estimators from this branch of research. Using the close connection
between factor models and the principal component analysis, Fan et al. (2013)
infer the necessary factor loadings by running a singular value decomposition
on the sample covariance matrix as
ΣS =
K
X
i=1
λiviv′
i +
n
X
i=K+1
λiviv′
i.
The covariance, formed by the ﬁrst K principal components, contains most
of the information about the implied structure. The rest is assumed to be an
approximately sparse matrix, estimated by applying an adaptive thresholding
procedure (Cai and Liu 2011) with a threshold parameter c.4 As a result, the
POET estimator becomes
ΣPOET =
K
X
i=1
λiviv′
i + bΣc
u,K .
(7)
3 Following this deﬁnition and assuming K common factors with K < n, a covariance
matrix estimator based on factor models only needs to estimate K(K + 1)/2 covariance
entries and is thus more stable.
4 For the operational use of POET, the threshold value c needs to be determined, so that
the positive-deﬁniteness of b
Σc
u,K is assured in ﬁnite samples. The choice of c can therefore
occur from a set, for which the respective minimal eigenvalue of the errors’ covariance matrix
after thresholding is positive. The minimal constant c that guarantees positive-deﬁniteness
is then chosen. For more details, see, Fan et al. (2013).

As argued by Fan et al. (2013), for high-dimensional asset returns with a
suﬃciently large n →∞, the number of factors K can be inferred from the
data. A consistent data-driven estimator for K is

where kmax is the predeﬁned maximum number of factors, R is the matrix
of asset returns with a sample covariance matrix ΣS, Fk is a T × k matrix
with columns the eigenvectors, corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues of
ΣS, and g (T, n) is a penalty function of the type, introduced by Bai and Ng
(2002). In this study we further examine whether the proposed CV approach
can select optimal values for K by considering the out-of-sample performance
measure of interest as a selection criterion.
2.5 Graphical Model
A proper estimation of the covariance matrix of returns is crucial in a portfolio
optimization context, since its inverse Θ = Σ−1 is the direct input parameter
necessary for exploiting diversiﬁcation eﬀects upon optimization. Instead of
imposing a factor structure on the covariance matrix with a sparse error co-
variance as in POET, sparsity in the precision matrix can be a valid approach
for reducing estimation errors, especially in the case of conditional indepen-
dence among asset pairs (Fan et al. 2016). In detail, the entry Θi,j = 0 if
and only if asset returns ri and rj are independent, conditional on the other
assets in the investment universe. Since graphical models are used to describe
both the conditional and unconditional dependence structures of a set of vari-
ables, the estimation of Θ is closely related to graphs under a Gaussian model.
The identiﬁcation of zeros in the inverse can be performed with the Gaussian
graphical model, since within the Markowitz portfolio optimization framework
asset returns are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution.5
One of the most commonly used methods for inducing sparsity on the
precision matrix is by penalizing the maximum-likelihood. For i.i.d. R with
R ∼N (0, Σ), the Gaussian log-likelihood function is given by
L (Θ) = log |Θ| −tr

bΣSΘ

,
(9)
where |·| denotes the determinant and tr(.) the trace of a matrix. Maximizing
Equation (9) alone yields the known maximum-likelihood estimator for the
precision matrix bΘS, which suﬀers from high estimation error in case of high-
dimensionality. To reduce such errors, the maximum log-likelihood function
5 This idea was ﬁrst proposed by Dempster (1972) with the so-called covariance selection
model.

can be penalized by adding a lasso penalty (Tibshirani 1996) on the precision
matrix entries as
L (Θ) = log |Θ| −tr

−ρ
Θ−

(10)
where ||Θ−||1 is the L1-norm (the sum of the absolute values) of the matrix
Θ−, an n×n matrix with the oﬀ-diagonal elements, equal to the corresponding
elements of the precision matrix Θ and the diagonal elements equal to zero.6
Furthermore, ρ is a penalty parameter that controls the sparsity level, with
higher ρ values leading to a larger number of oﬀ-diagonal zero elements within
the resulting estimator.
The penalized likelihood framework for a sparse graphical model estimation
was ﬁrst proposed by Yuan and Lin (2007), who solve Equation (10) with an
interior-point method. Banerjee et al. (2008) show that the problem is convex
and solve it for Σ with a box-constrained quadratic program. To date, the
fastest available solution for the sparse graphical model in Equation (10) is
reached with the GLASSO algorithm, developed by Friedman et al. (2008)
and later improved by Witten et al. (2011). They demonstrate that the above
formulation is equivalent to an N-coupled lasso problem and solve it using a
coordinate descent procedure.
In addition to a well-performing algorithm, the value of ρ is necessary for
calculating the optimal GLASSO estimator. For this purpose, Yuan and Lin
(2007) suggest using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), deﬁned for
each ρ as
BIC(ρ) = −log

where the indicator function 1{ b
Θρ,ij̸=0} counts the number of nonzero oﬀ-
diagonal elements in the estimated precision matrix. The value of ρ, corre-
sponding to the lowest BIC, is chosen as the optimal lasso penalty parameter.
The choice of the BIC as a selection criterion for ρ is further justiﬁed by the
relation between the penalized problem in Equation (10) and the model selec-
tion criteria (Goto and Xu 2015). Although Yuan and Lin (2007) argue that
a CV procedure for an optimal lasso penalty can yield better out-of-sample
results, the existing ﬁnancial applications estimate ρ only once in-sample.7
By contrast, next to such conservative approach, we consider the superior-
ity of data-driven methods in the context of lasso regularization and perform
additionally a multi-fold CV with risk-related selection criteria. The exact
methodology is described in the next section.
6 This insures that no penalty is applied to the asset returns’ sample variances.
7 Goto and Xu (2015) induce sparsity to enhance robustness and lower the estimation error
within portfolio hedging strategies, Brownlees et al. (2018) develop a procedure called “re-
alized network” by applying GLASSO as a regularization procedure for realized covariance
estimators, and Torri et al. (2019) analyze the out-of-sample performance of a minimum-
variance portfolio, estimated with GLASSO.

3 Data-Driven Methodology
Each of the outlined covariance estimators includes an exogenous or data-
dependent parameter. The linear shrinkage estimators in Equations (2) and
(3) are calculated with an optimal shrinkage intensity bs. For the more gen-
eral nonlinear shrinkage Ledoit and Wolf (2017) set the kernel bandwidth’s
speed at −0.35 as the average of two recognized approaches. The approxi-
mate factor model, the POET estimator by Fan et al. (2013), deals with an
unknown number of factors K, which are identiﬁed by minimizing popular
information criteria. Finally, the GLASSO estimator proposed by Friedman
et al. (2008) needs an optimal choice for the penalty parameter ρ, often esti-
mated by minimizing the BIC in-sample. To clarify our analysis, we refer to
these estimation methods as ‘original’. In addition, we adopt a nonparamet-
ric technique, a multi-fold CV, to identify the necessary parameter for each
estimation method in a data-driven way. Instead of relying on pre-speciﬁed
assumptions and deriving corresponding solutions individually, we perform a
grid search over a domain of values and ﬁnd the best possible parameter for
two exemplary out-of-sample statistics.
3.1 Parameter Set
To employ a data-driven choice, we ﬁrst need to specify a domain of possible
values for the necessary parameters that should be selected within the CV
procedure. For this purpose we create a sequence (or grid) of arbitrary param-
eters δ ∈∆for each covariance model. Depending on the chosen length of the
sequence, the CV can be computationally time-consuming. Since the choice
of this sequence is crucial for the out-of-sample eﬃciency of the data-driven
methodology, the domain of possible parameters has to be individually evalu-
ated for each estimation method by considering the trade-oﬀbetween desired
precision and computing time. Subsection 4.2 outlines the examined sequences
for the considered covariance estimation methods.
3.2 Cross-Validation Procedure
The CV is a model validation technique designed to assess how an estimated
model would perform on an unknown dataset. To evaluate the model accuracy,
the available dataset is repeatedly split into a training and a testing subset in
a rolling-window fashion (see, e.g., Refaeilzadeh et al. 2009; Arlot et al. 2010).
For instance, in the case of an m-fold CV, a dataset with τ observations is split
into m equal parts. The ﬁrst rolling-window then uses as a training dataset the
ﬁrst fold consisting of the ﬁrst ν < τ observations ordered by time. Upon this,
the consecutive υ observations are used to validate the performed estimation
as a test dataset. This is iteratively done m times by shifting the training
window by υ observations and, therefore, maintaining the chronological order
within the data.

11
In our setting, for each of the pre-deﬁned parameters we successively use
the training data to calculate a covariance matrix estimator bΣt,δ for a test
dataset t and a speciﬁc parameter δ.8 During the following validation stage,
we must set selection criteria, also referred to as measures of ﬁt, to identify
which parameter performs best. In this study, we investigate two common
objectives within the ﬁeld of portfolio risk minimization.
As often argued, the squared forecasting error (SFE) or, as deﬁned in
Section 2, the Frobenius loss, is minimized to ﬁnd a covariance estimator with
the least forecasting error (see, e.g., Zakamulin 2015). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst
calculate a realized covariance matrix for the test dataset with
Σt = (Rt −bµt1)′ (Rt −bµt1) ,
where Rt ∈Rυ×n are the asset returns from the test dataset and bµt is the
vector of average returns for the testing period consisting of υ observations.
Then, we ﬁnd the corresponding SFE as

 bΣt,δ −Σt

F .
This procedure is repeated m times, so that we end up with m SFE values for
each δ. From the parameter set we then choose this δ for which the average
(over all m iterations) SFE is minimized. In our empirical study, the data-
driven estimation method with the SFE as a measure of ﬁt is referred to as
CV1.
Instead of the SFE, within a portfolio optimization framework, one is gen-
erally more interested in whether a covariance estimator leads to lower out-of-
sample risk of the optimal portfolio (see, e.g., Liu 2014; Ledoit and Wolf 2017;
Engle et al. 2019). To incorporate and later investigate this concept, as our
second scenario (CV2), we minimize the out-of-sample portfolio variance. In
detail, with the covariance matrix bΣt,δ, previously estimated with the training
data, we calculate the optimal weights bwt,δ for a portfolio of our choice (e.g.,
the GMV). This then allows us to calculate the respective portfolio returns
throughout the testing period with υ observations as
rp
t,δ = bw′
t,δRt.
This procedure is repeated m times, so that we end up with m portfolio return
vectors for each δ. From the parameter set, we then choose this δ for which
the empirical variance (over all m iterations) of those portfolio out-of-sample
returns is minimized.
By applying diﬀerent measures of ﬁt within the data-driven methodology
we explicitly address the importance of aligned selection criteria for the out-of-
sample performance of each covariance estimation method. Moreover, we aim
to verify whether the estimation of covariance parameters with a multi-fold
CV yields better results out-of-sample than the original models.
8 For clarity in the notation, we do not diﬀerentiate between covariance estimators. The
procedure is applied to all methods equally.

4 Empirical Study
To exploit the above considerations, we perform an extensive empirical study
of the suggested covariance estimation methods within a high-dimensional
portfolio optimization context. For this purpose, we create GMV portfolios
with and without short sales and evaluate their out-of-sample performance for
a range of commonly used measures. We additionally compare the theoretical
covariance parameters with their calibrated equivalents. The exact empirical
construct is elaborated on in the following subsections.

For the empirical study, we focus on the GMV portfolio. The optimal weights
for an investment period t are determined by minimizing the portfolio variance
as
bwt = arg min
w
w′ bΣtw
s.t.
1′
nw = 1 ,
(12)
where 1n is an n-dimensional vector of ones and bΣt is an arbitrary covariance
matrix estimator for the investment period t. This formulation has the analyt-
ical solution bwt =
b
Σ−1
t
1n
1′n b
Σ−1
t
1n . Furthermore, we consider a GMV portfolio with
an imposed constraint on the weights (GMV-NOSHORT),
bwt = arg min
w
w′ bΣtw
s.t.
1′
nw = 1 and w ≥0 ,
(13)
which is a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints that can be
solved with every popular quadratic optimization software.9 As discussed by
recent literature (see, e.g., Jagannathan and Ma 2003; DeMiguel et al. 2009b),
the introduction of a short-sale constraint is not only practically relevant be-
cause of common fund rules or budget constraints for individual investors. It
moreover limits the estimation error in the portfolio weights. As a consequence,
we would expect a slightly reduced eﬀect of the estimation methods’ eﬃciency
in respect to the out-of-sample performance. The empirical analysis of GMV-
NOSHORT portfolios thus aims to complement our study and to ensure the
practical reproducibility and relevance of our results.
9 The measure of ﬁt within CV2, the portfolio variance, depends on the estimated optimal
weights. When short sales are allowed, we use the solution of Equation (12) to calculate
the portfolio variance as in Subsection 3.2. For the case of GMV-NOSHORT, we solve
Equation (13) within the CV.

4.2 Data and Methodology
To test the performance of the proposed covariance matrix estimation meth-
ods, we utilize four S&P 500 related datasets, which diﬀer only in the number of
assets used: 50, 100, 200 and 250 stocks. Throughout our study the datasets are
referred to as 50SP, 100SP, 200SP and 250SP, respectively. Choosing datasets
with diﬀerent quantities of assets, we aim to study the behavior of covariance
estimators when the concentration ratio becomes increasingly large in-sample.
As common within the research on such high-dimensional covariance estima-
tion (see, e.g., Fan et al. 2013; Ledoit and Wolf 2017; Engle et al. 2019), we
consider daily prices.10 For our out-of-sample analysis we use daily returns,
starting on 01/01/1990 and ending on 12/31/2018. Overall, our data include
observations for T = 348 months (or 7306 days) per asset.
To ensure the stability in our results, we randomly select the necessary
number of stocks among all the companies that have survived throughout
the investigated period and keep them as the investment universe for our
empirical study. Since the chosen datasets consist of individual stocks, the
adopted investment strategies can be recreated easily and cost eﬃciently in
practice by simply buying or selling the respective amount of stocks.
To evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the constructed portfolios
and, implicitly, the covariance estimation methods, we adopt a rolling-window
study with an in-sample period of two years, τ = 24 months (or roughly 504
days), and an out-of-sample period from 01/01/1992 to 12/31/2018, resulting
in T −τ = 324 months (or 6801 days) out-of-sample portfolio returns. Similarly
to the original studies on the reviewed covariance estimation methods (Fan
et al. 2013; Ledoit and Wolf 2017; Engle et al. 2019), we employ a monthly
rebalancing strategy, since this is more cost eﬃcient and common in practice.
Within each rolling-window step, the covariance matrix of asset returns for the
investment month t is estimated at the end of month t−1 using approximately
the most recent 504 daily in-sample observations.
In our empirical study, the sample covariance estimator serves as a bench-
mark to the high-dimensional estimation methods and considered data-driven
adjustments in terms of out-of-sample risk. For the application of the non-
linear shrinkage, we use the MATLAB-code provided by Ledoit and Wolf.11.
The POET estimator is calculated using the R-package POET provided by Fan
et al. (2013). As suggested by the authors, we adopt a soft-thresholding rule
as well as a data-driven derivation of the number of factors and the thresh-
olding constant for the original version of the method. Finally, the GLASSO
estimator is calculated with the algorithm provided by Friedman et al. (2008)
within the R-package glasso with no penalty on the diagonal elements.
In addition to the models in Section 2, we calculate the data-driven esti-
mators as in Section 3 by applying an m-fold CV. To calculate the selection
criteria for the respective CV methods, we choose m = 12 and therefore di-

vide the in-sample observations into a training sample of 12 months (or 252
days) and a testing sample of one month (or 21 days). With this construction,
we replicate the proposed monthly rebalancing strategy inside the performed
CV. As introduced in Subsection 3.1, we additionally need to deﬁne a set of
parameters for each covariance estimation method.
Since both linear shrinkage methods in Equation (2) (LW1) and Equa-
tion (3) (LWCC) represent the weighted average between the sample and a
target covariance matrix, we deﬁne a parameter set ∆of G shrinkage in-
tensities, such that ∆1 = ∆CC = (δ1, δ2, . . . , δG) ∈[0, 1]. Considering the
reasoning in Subsection 2.3, for the nonlinear shrinkage estimator in Equa-
tion (6) (LWNL), we set the kernel bandwidth’s speed to lie between −0.2
and −0.5 with ∆NL = (δ1, δ2, . . . , δG) ∈[−0.2, −0.5]. Since the accuracy of
a data-driven estimation depends on the number of examined parameters,
with more parameters allowing for ﬁner results, we consider a linear grid
of G = 1000 equidistant values in the above cases. Furthermore, for the
POET estimator, we consider ∆POET = (δ1, δ2, . . . , δG) ∈{1, 2, . . . , 6}. For
the GLASSO estimator, we follow Friedman et al. (2008) and choose a se-
quence of penalty parameters ρ, derived from the training data. Speciﬁcally,
we deﬁne a logarithmic sequence 10log10(k(x,e,u,G)) as our ρ-generating func-
tion, where k(x, e, u, G) = (x−1)· e−u
G−1 +u with G = 50 number of parameters
in the sequence, u being the maximal absolute value of the sample covariance
matrix, estimated with the training dataset, and e = 0.01u.
After calculating all the possible combinations of original and data-driven
estimators within the validation subset, we choose an optimal parameter for
each covariance estimation method, as outlined in Subsection 3.2, and use
all the in-sample data to estimate the covariance matrix for the next in-
vestment month. Since the reviewed estimation methods and our data-driven
methodology do not model time-dependency in the covariance matrix, we set
bΣt = bΣt−1. We use bΣt to ﬁnd the optimal weights bwt, as in Equations (12)
and (13). With these weights, we calculate the out-of-sample portfolio returns
for each model in t. This procedure is repeated multiple times until the end of
our investment horizon.
Overall, our study covers 17 diﬀerent portfolios for each scenario with and
without short sales. First, we include the equally-weighted portfolio, hereafter
also referred to as the Naive portfolio. This strategy implies an identity co-
variance matrix and hence, does not include any estimation risk (DeMiguel
et al. 2009b). In addition to the Naive strategy, which is a standard bench-
mark when comparing induced transaction costs, we build a GMV portfolio
with the sample covariance matrix estimator, which serves as a benchmark
for the out-of-sample risk. For each of the ﬁve high-dimensional covariance
estimation methods discussed in Section 2, we construct portfolios with the
original and calibrated parameters, resulting in three versions for each esti-
mation methodology. All these portfolios are evaluated with the performance
measures, presented in the following subsection.

4.3 Performance Measures
To evaluate the out-of-sample performance of each covariance matrix estima-
tion method, we report diﬀerent performance measures for the estimator’s
eﬃciency and the risk proﬁle as well as the allocation properties of the corre-
sponding GMV and GMV-NOSHORT portfolios. First, we calculate the MSFE
as
MSFE =
1
T −τ
T −τ
X
t=τ
n
X
i=1
i
X
j=1

Σt,ij −bΣt,ij
2
,
(14)
where bΣt,ij is the covariance matrix estimator and Σt,ij is the realized covari-
ance for month t. The MSFE is frequently used to measure the forecasting
power of an estimation method. To avoid double accounting for forecasting
errors, we exclude the lower triangular part of both matrices from the calcu-
lation.
Considering the nature of minimum-variance portfolios as risk-reduction
strategies, we are especially interested in the out-of-sample SD as a perfor-
mance indicator. We calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the 6801 out-
of-sample portfolio returns and multiply by
√
252 to annualize it. For a more
detailed analysis of the out-of-sample risk of the constructed portfolios and
therefore, implicitly, covariance estimation methods, we perform the two-sided
Parzen Kernel HAC-test for diﬀerences in variances, as described by Ledoit
and Wolf (2008) and Ledoit and Wolf (2011), and report the corresponding
signiﬁcance levels. Since we utilize daily returns, a suﬃcient number of ob-
servations is available and a bootstrap technique is not essential.12 Since the
MSFE is closely related to the SFE optimality criterion, as within the CV1
method, we expect the respectively optimized covariance estimators to exhibit
a lower MSFE than their original versions. Moreover, a data-driven estima-
tion with the CV2 approach, based on minimizing the portfolio variance, is
expected to result in a lower out-of-sample SD.
In practice investors need to additionally address the problem of high trans-
action costs; hence, they prefer a more stable allocation for an optimal portfolio
strategy. Therefore, as a proxy for occurring transaction costs, we analyze the
average monthly turnover, deﬁned as
Turnover =
1
T −τ −1
T −τ−1
X
t=τ
 bwt+1 −bw+
t

1 ,
(15)
where || · ||1 denotes the ℓ1-norm of a vector as the sum of its absolute values
and bw+
t
denotes the portfolio weights at the end of the investment month
t, scaled back to one. The turnover rate is calculated as the averaged sum
of absolute values of the monthly rebalancing trades across all n assets and
over all investment dates T −τ −1. The next section reports the detailed
out-of-sample performance analysis and empirical results.
12 For the sake of completeness, we have also performed a block bootstrap as in Ledoit and
Wolf (2011). The corresponding signiﬁcant values are comparable to those from the HAC
test and are therefore not reported.

5 Empirical Results
In the empirical part to this paper we compare how the original and data-
driven methods for estimating the covariance matrix of returns aﬀect the out-
of-sample performance of GMV portfolios with and without short positions.
This section examines the out-of-sample properties of the three estimation
methodologies (original, CV1 and CV2).
5.1 Optimal Parameters
Figure 1 exemplary displays the selected linear shrinkage intensities for the
original as well as CV1- and CV2-based LW1 estimation methods in the case
of 50 stocks.13 The trend of the optimal linear shrinkage intensities shows that
the original approach of Ledoit and Wolf (2004b) is less reactive to changes
in asset returns than our CV methodologies. The strong ﬂuctuation in the se-
lected shrinkage intensity for CV1 and CV2 results from their data-driven na-
ture which implies fast adaptation to potentially changing market conditions.
Nevertheless, such volatility in the parameter estimation could have negative
eﬀects on the out-of-sample properties of the corresponding estimators and
thus, the estimated portfolios (e.g., in terms of turnover or an overall risk
level). Therefore, the sole observation of the chosen parameters cannot lead
to a clear conclusion on whether the CV technique enhances the covariance
matrix estimator and the respective portfolio performance. In the following
subsections we examine this behavior for the GMV portfolios with short sales.
5.2 GMV with short sales
Table 1 presents the central results of our empirical analysis on the GMV
portfolio. The columns show the investment universes with 50, 100, 200 and
250 randomly chosen S&P 500 stocks as well as the three performance measures
MSFE, SD and average monthly turnover rate (TO). The rows indicate the
portfolio strategies based on the covariance estimation. While the original
estimators are noted only by the respective name of the estimation method,
the endings CV1 and CV2 represent the data-driven approaches, as explained
in the previous sections.
The compact representation of the results allows us to observe that in the
case of enhanced covariance estimators the annualized SD declines as more as-
sets are included in the GMV portfolio. This is easily explained by the known
power of diversiﬁcation – the desirable eﬀect of including more stocks in a
13 Figure 2 shows the evolution of the selected parameters for the remaining covariance
estimation methods in the case of the 50 considered stocks. The other three datasets produce
similar results. To our surprise, the code for the POET estimator provided by Fan et al.
(2013) produces a consistent K = 2 number of factors throughout the observation period
and for all four datasets.

respective covariance estimators across all the considered datasets with 50, 100, 200 and 250 stocks, respectively. Since the Naive portfolio strategy does
not require a covariance estimator per deﬁnition, no values are reported for the MSFE. We report the lowest MSFE, SD, and TO for each estimation
method in bold. The best results in terms of the MSFE and SD for each dataset are underlined. We additionally underline the lowest TO, excluding the

portfolio. Not surprisingly however, the estimation error with the sample co-
variance estimator diminishes the positive diversiﬁcation eﬀect, as shown by
the increase in out-of-sample risk for the scenarios with 200 and 250 stocks.
All the eﬃcient covariance estimation methods perform better than the sam-
ple estimator in terms of out-of-sample risk for all the datasets, with larger
deviations for a higher concentration ratios.14
More importantly, we can clearly detect the positive eﬀect of the appro-
priate choice of selection criterion for determining the necessary covariance
parameters. For all the datasets, minimizing the portfolio variance with the
CV2 approach indeed leads to lower out-of-sample SD for the linear shrinkage
methods LW1 and LWCC and the GLASSO estimator. Especially noteworthy is
the continuous and strong risk-reduction property of the GLASSO model alone
14 Figure 3 provides a more visually attractive summary of the results for the GMV port-
folios in terms of out-of-sample risk. For those estimation methods more susceptible to the
tuning parameter, the diﬀerences in SD between the original, CV1, and CV2 methods are
more pronounced.

and in combination with CV2. First, among the original models, the GLASSO
estimation produces the best results for the 100SP and 250SP datasets. Sec-
ond, when the sparsity parameter for the GLASSO estimation is selected with
the CV2 approach, outperformance is superior for all the datasets. Hence, in
respect to out-of-sample risk, applying graph models to induce sparsity within
the precision matrix seems to be a valid approach, even in comparison to highly
sophisticated methods such as the nonlinear shrinkage and approximate factor
models. Interestingly, for the latter, the CV2 method does not lead to consis-
tent outperformance in terms of risk. The original version of POET performs
better than POET-CV2 in all cases but the 100SP dataset. In the case of GMV
portfolios with short sales this result implies that the application of the CV
with selection criteria such as SFE (CV1) and out-of-sample portfolio variance
(CV2) does not result in a more optimal number of factors than the originally
established function in Equation (8). Moreover, for LWNL, there is almost no
relevant diﬀerence in annualized out-of-sample SD. We can therefore argue
that the eﬃciency of LWNL does not strongly depend on the choice of the
kernel bandwidth’s speed and hence, a data-driven speciﬁcation cannot lead
to an improvement in the performance out-of-sample.
For the CV1 approach, the investigation of the MSFE is mandatory. The
values reported in Table 1 indicate the distinct eﬀect of the CV1 approach on
the minimization of the MSFE out-of-sample. For all the estimation methods
and datasets, except the isolated case of LWCC for 250SP, the MSFE is the
lowest for the CV1 version of every estimator. Even robust estimators such as
LWNL and POET exhibit higher forecasting power, measured by the MSFE,
when the corresponding parameters are estimated with the CV1 approach.
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the MSFE measure does not seem to proxy
for the out-of-sample portfolio risk level. Within the ﬁnancial literature in-
cluding Zakamulin (2015), the MSFE is studied in reference to datasets with
low concentration ratios. Within a high-dimensional setting, however, a lower
MSFE does not coincide with lower SD out-of-sample for any of the datasets
or estimation methods.15 Under the CV1 method, the SFE is computed as
an estimator’s squared distance to the monthly realized covariance matrix,
calculated on the basis of daily returns (roughly 21 days) for n assets. The im-
plied concentration ratios, ranging from 50/21 = 2.38 for the 50SP dataset to
250/21 = 11.90 for the 250SP dataset, lead to ill-conditioned realized covari-
ance matrices and a noisy SFE calculation.16 Therefore, we focus our further
analysis on the CV2 approach.
To understand the magnitude of improvements in the CV2-based estima-
tion methods as well as the superiority of the GLASSO method, Table 2
presents the diﬀerences in annualized SDs and the respective pairwise signiﬁ-
15 Only the LWNL estimator for the 200SP and 250SP datasets yields the lowest risk levels
and lowest MSFE for the CV1 approach. This result is merely based on a negligible diﬀerence
and can thus be ignored.
16 To solve this problem, recent ﬁnancial studies have focused on improving the estima-
tion of large realized covariance matrices (see, e.g., Hautsch et al. 2012; Callot et al. 2017;
Bollerslev et al. 2018).

cance levels across all the original covariance estimators and their CV2-based
counterparts for the high-dimensional case of the 250SP dataset.17 Table 2 is
to be read column-wise; that is, the diﬀerence in SD for the LW1 and Sample
estimator is listed under the second column for the ﬁrst row. For complete-
ness, we construct the table symmetrically. Still, we focus our attention on the
elements above the diagonal only.
At ﬁrst glance, we can once more distinguish the weak performance of
the sample covariance estimator. All the other estimators lead to signiﬁcantly
less out-of-sample risk with a p-value of roughly 0.001 or lower. The second
worst estimation method for this asset universe is the original LW1, followed
by LWCC. On the contrary, when the linear shrinkage intensity is optimized
for with respect to the out-of-sample portfolio variance with CV2, we ob-
serve an astonishing improvement for those estimators. Both LW1-CV2 and
LWCC-CV2 result in a signiﬁcantly lower out-of-sample SD than their original
counterparts. Comparing LWCC-CV2 with LW1-CV2, we can conclude that
linear shrinkage toward the identity matrix yields more stable and eﬃcient
portfolio allocation than the same technique applied to a constant correlation
model. It seems, therefore, that within the data-driven approach it is better
to assume less than assume the wrong structure. Another surprising insight
emerges from the comparison of LW1-CV2 with LWNL. Although especially
designed to overcome the high-dimensionality problem, both the original and
CV2-based nonlinear shrinkage methods lead to higher out-of-sample risk than
the data-driven linear shrinkage estimators. This eﬀect is observable for the
100SP dataset as well (see, for reference, Table 6). As the diﬀerence is not
statistically signiﬁcant in any of the cases, we can only draw a qualitative con-
clusion that a methodologically easy-to-understand and simple-to-implement
method can perform as well as a complex state-of-the-art estimator when the
necessary tuning parameter (here, the shrinkage intensity) is identiﬁed in a
data-driven way. With respect to the GLASSO estimation method, we ﬁnd
that GLASSO with CV2 results in a signiﬁcantly lower out-of-sample SD than
the original estimator (p-value of 0.01). This ﬁnding reveals that a suitable
selection criterion for the sparsity parameter is of utmost importance. Further-
more, GLASSO-CV2 yields signiﬁcantly lower out-of-sample portfolio variance
than the sample, LW1, LWCC, and POET estimators. LWNL is signiﬁcantly
outperformed by GLASSO-CV2 for the 50SP and 100SP datasets with a p-
value of 0.001 (see, for reference, the signiﬁcant levels in Table 5 and Table 6).
Overall, these results conﬁrm that GLASSO in combination with CV2 is the
most eﬃcient covariance estimator among the estimators considered in our
study.
Table 1 additionally reports the average monthly turnover rate as a proxy
for the arising transaction costs induced by monthly rebalancing. The Naive
portfolio, being long only and equally-weighted by construction, naturally has
the lowest turnover (approximately 0.06 on average across all the datasets). As

are less pronounced due to a lower dimensionality in the data.

expected, the GMV portfolios estimated with the sample covariance matrix are
characterized by extreme exposures for all the datasets. With higher dimen-
sionality the ill-conditioned sample estimator induces even stronger dispersion
in the portfolio weights. On the other hand, an estimation with GLASSO or
its CV-based equivalents has the most pronounced positive eﬀect on the allo-
cation characteristics of the GMV portfolio. In particular, the GLASSO-CV1
estimation methodology results in GMV portfolios with the lowest turnover for
the 200SP and 250SP datasets. For the least high-dimensional dataset, 50SP,
GLASSO-CV2 leads to the lowest turnover. An interesting case is the 100SP
dataset, where clear outperformance in terms of turnover rate occurs for the
estimator LW1-CV2, followed closely by GLASSO-CV1. It seems that when
the concentration ratio is tolerable, as for the case of 100SP, the linear shrink-
age methodology, as a convex combination between the sample covariance and
an identity matrix, produces satisfactory results. This can be explained by the
fact that the underlying model in LW1 is equivalent to the introduction of a
ridge type penalty in the estimation (Warton 2008), which has been proven
to induce stability. However, when the sample covariance matrix becomes ill-
conditioned, as for the 200SP and 250SP datasets, even a sophisticated data-
driven choice of the linear shrinkage intensity cannot outperform the GLASSO
estimation in terms of turnover. While LW1 shrinks the sample covariance ma-
trix toward the identity matrix, GLASSO shrinks the precision matrix toward
the identity matrix. Since the Naive portfolio corresponds to a GMV port-
folio estimated with an identity covariance and hence, precision matrix, one
may suggest that both estimation methods result in an implicit shrinkage of
the sample GMV portfolio weights toward an equally-weighted portfolio, as
in Tu and Zhou (2011), and therefore perform well in terms of turnover. Sur-
prisingly, the estimator LWNL is strongly outperformed by all the data-driven
estimators except POET with CV1 and CV2. For example, while GLASSO
achieves a turnover rate of 0.61 for 250SP, estimation with LWNL leads to 0.73
average monthly turnover. The application of CV1 and CV2 for determining
the sparsity parameter within the GLASSO model ampliﬁes this result. More
importantly, when a covariance estimator is susceptible to an improvement by
the data-driven estimation of the necessary parameters, as LW1, LWCC, and
GLASSO are, the implementation of CV leads to a strong positive impact on
the stability of optimal weights.
5.3 GMV without short sales
Focusing on more practically relevant portfolio strategies, we construct a
second set of GMV portfolios that do not exhibit negative weights (GMV-
NOSHORT). The exclusion of short sales is a common regulatory constraint
that strongly inﬂuences the optimal performance in respect to the out-of-
sample risk and the allocation of weights. To investigate those, Table 4 reports
the main out-of-sample measures for GMV-NOSHORT. Since the examined
short-sale constraint does not play any role in the CV1-based estimation of the

This table reports the annualized out-of-sample SD and average monthly turnover rate (TO) of the GMV-
NOSHORT portfolios across all the considered datasets with 50, 100, 200 and 250 stocks, respectively. We

covariance matrix, we do not report the MSFE values. The table is structured
similarly to Table 1 with the columns representing the investment universes
(50SP, 100SP, 200SP and 250SP), and performance measures, while the rows
indicate the portfolio strategies based on the considered covariance estimation
methods.
First, the sample covariance estimator leads to better results in comparison
to Table 1, verifying the impact of constraints on the minimization of estima-
tion errors in portfolio weights, as shown by Jagannathan and Ma (2003). In
contrast to the previous results, the diﬀerences in out-of-sample performance in
terms of portfolio risk are generally less distinctive among the estimation meth-
ods. While GLASSO-CV2 continues to achieve the lowest out-of-sample annu-
alized SD for all the datasets, a data-driven approach only inconsistently en-
hances the performance of the other original estimation methods. For instance,
both LW1 and LWCC perform better than their CV2-based counterparts for
the 100SP and 200SP datasets. Although both the nonlinear shrinkage and
POET with CV2-estimated parameters seem to produce lower out-of-sample
risk, the eﬀect is negligible.18 Moreover, Table 3 presents the diﬀerences in
annualized SDs and the respective pairwise signiﬁcance levels across all the
main covariance estimation methods and their CV2-based counterparts for

the high-dimensional case of the 250SP dataset.19 The table is constructed
similarly to Table 2.
The ﬁrst notable consequence of the short-sale constraint is the improve-
ment in portfolio performance for the case of the sample covariance matrix.
Table 3 shows that only the POET estimators with and without CV2 yield a
statistically lower out-of-sample SD than the sample covariance matrix with
a p-value of 0.001. Both the original and the CV2-based POET estimation
methods result in a lower out-of-sample portfolio variance than all the other
methods except LWCC and GLASSO-CV2. However, although GLASSO-CV2
outperforms all the other estimators qualitatively, the results are signiﬁcant
only compared to the original GLASSO estimator with a p-value of 0.001.
This once more conﬁrms that, ﬁrst, the sparsity parameter for GLASSO is
best determined with a CV and, second, the selection criterion within the CV
should match the performance measure. In general, when no short sales are
allowed, POET-CV2 and GLASSO-CV2 consistently outperform the rest of
the methods (see, for reference, Tables 9 and 10 for the other datasets). For
a less high-dimensional dataset, such as 100SP, the out-of-sample SD gener-
ated with GLASSO-CV2 is even signiﬁcantly lower than the out-of-sample SD
induced by POET. Although less pronounced, the positive eﬀects of a CV
methodology with an adequate selection criterion, namely the variance of a
short sales constrained GMV, are noticeable here as well. In particular, the
usage of GLASSO-CV2 signiﬁcantly improves the out-of-sample risk of a GMV
without short sales for the 50SP, 100SP, and 250SP datasets.20
Finally, we examine the average monthly turnover rates, reported in Ta-
ble 4. Since the portfolios are optimized with the additional no short-sale
constraint, we expect the optimal weights to be much less dispersed across the
rebalancing periods. Such behavior in turn results in lower turnover rates and
transaction costs. In comparison to the GMV portfolios from Subsection 5.2,
the turnover reduction is present even for the case of the ill-conditioned sample
covariance estimator. The latter still performs worst, compared to the other
methods with more dispersion in the weights for high-dimensional datasets
such as 200SP and 250SP. In addition, for those datasets, we observe the
lowest turnover rates when GLASSO-CV2 is used, followed by LWNL with a
diﬀerence of one percent. We therefore continue to observe the positive eﬀects
of a data-driven estimation with the portfolio variance as a measure of ﬁt not
only on the out-of-sample risk but as well on the turnover rates.
6 Conclusion
In this study, we review some of the most recent and eﬃcient estimation meth-
ods for high-dimensional minimum-variance portfolios. We extend the current

research by proposing a data-driven methodology to determine the correspond-
ing tuning parameters such as the linear shrinkage intensity and the sparsity
penalty term.
In a detailed empirical analysis with four datasets, we identify the charac-
teristics of our data-driven methodology. First, we establish that the selection
criterion within the CV should correspond to the performance measure of
interest. We show that the lowest overall out-of-sample portfolio risk is in-
deed generated when we select the optimal tuning parameters by minimizing
the portfolio variance with the proposed CV. In particular, the application of
this procedure to each of the considered estimators with the exception of the
nonlinear shrinkage leads to superior GMV or GMV-NOSHORT portfolios in
terms of out-of-sample SD and average turnover rates. The performance of
the nonlinear shrinkage estimator is only slightly aﬀected by the speed of the
kernel bandwidth and a data-driven selection of this speed does not lead to a
signiﬁcantly lower risk. Moreover, the POET estimator in combination with a
CV technique seems to perform generally better under the scenario of short
sales constraints. On the other hand, the GLASSO estimator clearly outper-
forms the other high-dimensional estimation methods for all data scenarios
considered when calibrated accordingly. This not only provides new insights
into the application of GLASSO in the portfolio context, but also conﬁrms the
relationship between lasso regulation and the power of CV in a covariance esti-
mation context. We additionally demonstrate that a data-driven methodology
is beneﬁcial to estimators whose performance depends strongly on the em-
bedded tuning parameters, as is the case with linear shrinkage and GLASSO
estimation methods. Even complex and highly eﬃcient estimators can be sur-
passed by simpler approaches if a sophisticated data-driven technique is used.
One of the reasons for this observation is the rapid adaptation of the CV
toward ever-changing market situations.
Within our analysis we investigate only high-dimensional covariance esti-
mation methods that assume homoscedasticity in the returns. Since we observe
a time-variable parameter selection with the CV approach and a resulting im-
provement in the out-of-sample performance, we argue that the combination of
data-driven parameter evaluation and time-dependent high-dimensional vari-
ance estimators, as recently proposed by Halbleib and Voev (2014) and Engle
et al. (2019), is an important topic for future research.

This table shows the diﬀerences in the annualized out-of-sample SD of the GMV-50SP portfolios across the main covariance estimation methods and their CV2-based counterparts.
The table is constructed in a symmetrical way with an applied color scheme from red (higher SD than the other model) to green (lower SD than the other model). In addition, on the
elements above the diagonal, the signiﬁcant pairwise outperformance in terms of variance is denoted by asterisks: *** denotes signiﬁcance at the 0.001 level; ** denotes signiﬁcance at
the 0.01 level; and * denotes signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level. Finally, for each model, we report the percentage of the other models that exhibit higher variance as a qualitative measure.

This table shows the diﬀerences in the annualized out-of-sample SD of the GMV-200SP portfolios across the main covariance estimation methods and their CV2-based counterparts.
The table is constructed in a symmetrical way with an applied color scheme from red (higher SD than the other model) to green (lower SD than the other model). In addition, on the
elements above the diagonal, the signiﬁcant pairwise outperformance in terms of variance is denoted by asterisks: *** denotes signiﬁcance at the 0.001 level; ** denotes signiﬁcance at
the 0.01 level; and * denotes signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level. Finally, for each model, we report the percentage of the other models that exhibit higher variance as a qualitative measure.
