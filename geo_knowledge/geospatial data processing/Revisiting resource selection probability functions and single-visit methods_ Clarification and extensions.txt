Summary

(1) Models accounting for imperfect detection are important. Single-visit methods have been 
proposed as an alternative to multiple-visits methods to relax the assumption of closed 
population. Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) showed that under certain models of 
probability of detection single-visit methods are statistically non-identifiable leading to biased 
population estimates.  
(2) There is a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability function 
(RSPF) using weighted distributions and single-visit methods for occupancy and abundance 
estimation. We explain the precise mathematical conditions needed for RSPF estimation as 
stated in Lele and Keim (2006). The identical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on 
single-visit methodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the 
class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the application of the 
RSPF or the single-visit methodology.  
(3) To complement the work by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of 
multiple-visit methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of 
situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function multiple-visits methods also 
lead to biased estimates.  
(4) As a solution to this problem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models 
that allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension of single 
visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection function satisfies the RSPF 
condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the scaling factor depends on covariates, then it 
can also be estimated.

(5) We argue that the instances where the RSPF condition is not satisfied are rare in practice. 
Hence we disagree with the implication in Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) that the need for 
RSPF condition makes single-visit methodology irrelevant in practice.

Introduction 
Occupancy models (MacKenzie et al. 2002) and N-mixture models (Royle 2004) are popular 
approaches to deal with imperfect detection of unmarked organisms. These methods, in their 
original formulations, require replicate-visits to sites. For the identifiability of the model 
parameters, these methods need that the population be closed during the replicate-visits, i.e. there 
is no emigration, immigration, births or deaths between the visits. This assumption is often 
difficult to satisfy in practice and can lead to biased estimates of occupancy or abundance (Rota 
et al. 2009, Bayne et al. 2011). Logistical and cost related issues arise naturally when conducting 
repeated surveys. For example, is it pragmatic to visit many sites a small number of times or a 
small number of sites many times? Lele et al. (2012) and Sólymos et al. (2012) proposed a 
solution where they showed that under some easily satisfied conditions the single-visit surveys 
could be used to correct for imperfect detection. This avoids the need for the closed population 
assumption and eliminates the costs associated with repeated visits. The single-visit approach is 
logistically simpler and can be applied to historical data sets that lack replicated surveys. It can 
also be argued that, with the same budget, a single-visit methodology allows researchers to study 
larger geographical areas than replicate-visit methods and thus gain greater generality. Given the 
financial limitations most ecological studies face, this can be an important deciding factor.

In a recent paper, Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015), henceforth referred to as K&K, 
showed that under the log-link and the scaled logistic model for probability of detection, the 
single-visit method can estimate relative change in the abundances but not the absolute 
abundances. They also point out the relationship between their results and possible problems in 
the estimation of resource selection probability functions (RSPF) as suggested in Lele and Keim 
(2006). We are very grateful to the authors for pointing out these issues and particularly the 
relationship with results in Lele and Keim (2006).  
The comments by K&K have made us think about our methodology in a rigorous fashion. 
We realized that in our papers on single-visit methodology we should have stated the necessary 
conditions on the class of permissible models for probability of detection and occupancy under 
which the identifiability holds. Such a condition, which we now refer to as RSPF condition, was 
stated in Lele and Keim (2006). If the RSPF condition is satisfied, it is possible to estimate 
absolute probability of selection. Similarly if the models for probability of detection satisfy the 
RSPF condition, the results related to single-visit methodology remain valid. We note that both 
K&K and Hastie and Fithian (2013) observe non-identifiability because the log-link and the 
scaled logistic model do not satisfy the RSPF condition. Fortunately, neither the log-link nor the 
scaled logistic model has found much use in practice. In our experience, most models that are 
actually used in practice do satisfy the RSPF condition. In this paper, we argue that providing 
recommendations for statistical methods should not ignore practical considerations, namely, how 
often an extreme situation when the method fails is likely to happen in practice. 
The RSPF condition: permissible class of models 
Estimation of the probability of selection 

5 
 
For pedagogical reasons, we start with the problem of estimation of absolute probability of 
selection from the use-available data (Lele and Keim 2006). Let 𝑓𝐴(𝑥)and 𝑓𝑈(𝑥) denote the 
distribution of resources on available and used units respectively. They are related to each other 
as: 𝑓𝑈(𝑥) =
𝜋(𝑥;𝛽)𝑓𝐴(𝑥)
∫𝜋(𝑥;𝛽)𝑓𝐴(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 where 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) denotes the probability of selecting the  
resource 
, given that it is encountered (Lele and Keim 2006; Lele et al. 2013). It is called the 
resource selection probability function (RSPF). By definition, the function 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) is any 
function that takes values between 0 and 1. The ratio function 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)/𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽), the relative 
probability of selection, is commonly known as the Resource Selection Function (RSF). We 
emphasize that this ratio function need not be an exponential function. For example, if 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) is 
based on a logit or complementary log-log link, the ratio function 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)/𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽) is not an 
exponential function.  
It is well established that, given data arising from 𝑓𝑈(𝑥), one can estimate the ratio 
𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)/𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽). However, because the scientific interest lies in estimating 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽), Lele and 
Keim (2006) asked the question: If we have an estimate of the ratio 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)/𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽), what 
conditions will allow inference on 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)? Or, equivalently, can we identify the parameter 𝛽 
using only the knowledge of the ratio function? The necessary condition for this was found to be 
as follows: The RSPF 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) should be such that if 𝛽≠𝛽∗, then sup
𝑥
|𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) −𝐾𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽∗)| >
0 for any constant K > 0 (Lele and Keim, 2006; Gilbert et al. 1999). For ease of reference, we 
call this the RSPF condition and the class of models that satisfy this condition as RSPF model 
class. Loosely speaking, the RSPF condition reduces to the following two conditions: (1) Not all 
covariates in the model are categorical, and (2) the function log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) is non-linear and 
involves all components of the parameter vector.  
x

6 
 
We first note that the exponential function or scaled logistic (or, in general any scaled 
function) with unknown scaling constant, do not satisfy the RSPF condition. If all covariates in 
the model are categorical covariates with finite number of categories, from the log-linear model 
theory it follows that the probability of selection is necessarily modeled by the exponential 
function. Hence we need the condition that not all covariates are categorical. In the following, we 
explain the mathematical reasoning behind the RSPF condition in a simple situation.  
A necessary step in any model fitting exercise is that we have an idea about the form of 
the model that we want to fit. Hence we assume that the model form 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) is specified. Given 
this model specification, the goal of statistical analysis is to infer about the parameter 𝛽. First we 
note that if we know the ratio 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽)/𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽), we know the difference log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) −
log 𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽). For the simplicity of the argument, let us consider the case where there is only one 
continuous covariate and that the function is differentiable in x. Then, knowing the difference 
log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) −log 𝜋(𝑦; 𝛽) for every pair (x,y) is equivalent to knowing 
𝑑
𝑑𝑥log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽). It follows 
that only those parameters that are involved in the function 
𝑑
𝑑𝑥log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) are potentially 
identifiable. Further, the RSPF condition can be restated as a necessary and sufficient condition: 
𝑑
𝑑𝑥log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) =
𝑑
𝑑𝑥log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽∗) if and only if 𝛽= 𝛽∗. The RSPF condition restricts the model 
space for 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) so that 
𝑑
𝑑𝑥log 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) depends on all components of the parameter vector 𝛽. 
This leads to a simple conclusion that RSPF model class consists of functions that can be written 
as: 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) = 𝑐(𝛽)𝑔(𝑥; 𝛽) where 𝑐(𝛽) is not a constant function of 𝛽. Simple calculus shows 
that if RSPF is based on logit or complementary log-log link function, the RSPF condition is 
satisfied. Consideration of the polynomial functions in the exponent part of the logistic or 
complementary log-log functions provides us with a very flexible class of models that satisfy the 

7 
 
RSPF condition (Figure 1). Such functions take values between 0 and 1 but may never reach or 
even come arbitrarily close to either of the boundary values (Figures 1 and 2). In the Supporting 
Information we provide a simple program to generate data under any RSPF model and to 
estimate its parameters. Readers can try different model forms for 𝜋(𝑥; 𝛽) and see for themselves 
if the methods work or not. Remember that if the non-linearity on the log-scale is weak, one may 
need very large sample sizes to get reasonable estimates. 
Single-visit occupancy studies 
Let z and x denote the covariates that affect detection and occupancy respectively. Let 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃) 
and Ψ(𝑥; 𝛽) denote the probability of detection and probability of occupancy respectively. 
Again, for the sake of simplicity, we will consider single continuous covariates. It is trivial to see 
that we can estimate 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃)Ψ(𝑥; 𝛽) from single-visit data. The question is: Given this product, 
when can we separate out the components?  
For notational simplicity, let us denote the product function 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃)𝛹(𝑥; 𝛽) by 
ℎ(𝑥, 𝑧; 𝛽, 𝜃). We first note that if we know ℎ(𝑥, 𝑧; 𝛽, 𝜃) and one of the components, say 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃), 
then we can obtain the other component, 𝛹(𝑥; 𝛽). Second thing to note is that the ratio 
𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃)/𝑝(𝑧′; 𝜃) can be obtained from the product function by ℎ(𝑥, 𝑧; 𝛽, 𝜃)/ℎ(𝑥, 𝑧′; 𝛽, 𝜃). Hence 
it follows that the necessary condition for identifiability is that 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃) belongs to the RSPF 
model class. Conversely, we may impose the condition that 𝛹(𝑥; 𝛽) belongs to the RSPF model 
class. The RSPF condition needs to be satisfied by at least one of the two components. This 
allows us to decompose the product function into two components. However, to determine which 
component is detection and which component is occupancy, we need to impose the condition 
that the set of covariates that affect detection and covariates that affect occupancy should not be 
completely overlapping. 

8 
 
Because of the low information content in binary data, estimation of occupancy and 
detection from single-survey data is extremely difficult (Welsh et al. 2013). As described in Lele 
et al. (2012) and Moreno and Lele (2010), one may need to use penalized likelihood function to 
stabilize the estimators. Unfortunately it is not clear how to choose a good penalty function in 
general. In the supplementary information, we use a quasi-Bayesian approach where the means 
of the prior distributions for the parameters are determined from the observations themselves 
instead of based on a probabilistic quantification of ‘belief’. This seems to stabilize the 
estimation process considerably, resulting in estimators that are nearly unbiased. Unfortunately 
this estimation method lacks a strong theoretical basis. We are currently exploring the use of 
expert opinion (Lele and Allen 2006) to stabilize the estimators in this situation. 
Single-visit abundance surveys 
As compared to species occupancy, abundance data are more informative and hence there seems 
to be little need for stabilizing the estimators. Under the log-link model for the abundances, it is 
clear that one can obtain estimates of 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃) exp(𝑋𝛽). Hence, following the logic described 
above, as long as 𝑝(𝑧; 𝜃) belongs to the RSPF model class, we can estimate the abundances 
using single-visit survey data, irrespective of the link function for the abundance. 
Notice that RSPF model class does not require models to reach the boundary values 0 or 
1 for any covariate combination (Figure 2). In the supplementary material, we provide programs 
that the readers can use to test the results described above. We also note that, given the non-
linear nature of the problem, it is analytically impossible to know if the solution to the likelihood 
equation will be unique. One may use the data cloning method (Lele et al. 2010, Sólymos 2010, 
Campbell and Lele 2014) to diagnose the non-uniqueness of the solution. 
Sensitivity to model assumptions 

9 
 
We have now clarified the precise mathematical conditions under which single-survey 
methodology is valid. Clearly the log-link and scaled logistic model used in K&K do not satisfy 
the RSPF condition and hence if the true detection probability function is a scaled logistic 
function, the estimates are biased. Curiously, however, K&K seem to imply that because true 
detection function may not necessarily satisfy the RSPF condition, single-visit methodology 
should not be used in practice. Our disagreement is with this implication. 
Such an implication is very strange on two accounts. First, it is well known that validity 
of every statistical method depends on assumptions. The results are sensitive to the violation of 
these assumptions. Second, and more importantly, whether the true generating mechanism 
satisfies all the assumptions can seldom be known. For example, ecologists use maximum 
likelihood estimators (MLE) and the associated confidence intervals that are based on the result 
that the MLEs are consistent and asymptotically normal. This result holds true only if a number 
of regularity conditions are satisfied by the underlying true mechanism. Aside from the basic 
requirement that the model parameters are identifiable, the regularity conditions relate to the 
expected value of the higher order derivatives of the log-likelihood function. In the dependent 
data situation, one needs that the underlying true mechanism is a ϕ-mixing process of certain 
order. Population time series analysis is a common research activity in quantitative ecology. We 
are not aware of any papers that prove that the true underlying mechanism satisfies this mixing 
condition and other regularity conditions. Hierarchical models are also commonly used to 
analyze ecological data. These models make distributional assumptions about the latent 
variables. Statistical inferences are sensitive to the distributional assumptions on latent variable 
and in most cases one cannot test the validity of the latent variable model specification. In many 
cases, these latent variables do not even correspond to any observable characteristics and hence 

10 
 
there is not even a potential to test the assumptions in practice. We can continue with this list ad 
infinitum but the moral of the story is that it is not a news that statistical methods are sensitive to 
model misspecification. Moreover, one cannot always test the validity of the model specification.  
We do not take an issue with K&K’s mathematical findings that single-visit method is 
sensitive to the RSPF condition. As we showed above, one can launch such a criticism against 
every statistical method that has ever been proposed. We note that the multiple-visit N-mixture 
(MV) method is not criticized for simply being sensitive to the closed population assumption; it 
is criticized because the closed population assumption is seldom satisfied in practice (Bayne et 
al. 2011, Chandler et al. 2011, Dail and Madsen 2011). If this assumption were satisfied in most 
situations, we would be using MV method without qualms. It is well known that the standard 
bootstrap method fails if, among many other regularity conditions, the underlying true 
distribution is heavy tailed (Athreya, 1987). In spite of the possibility that the underlying true 
distribution may be heavy tailed, we continue to use the bootstrap method in practice because 
our experience suggests that such situations are rare.  
Vast scientific experience, not only in the field of detection error but also in various other 
scientific ventures, of modeling probability of an event suggests that most probability models 
that are actually used in practice do satisfy the RSPF condition. Hence we claim that the 
detection error models are more likely to satisfy the RSPF condition than not and that we are 
likely to be correct with our inferences.  
As we have already acknowledged, single-visit methods are sensitive to the violation of 
the RSPF condition. There are two ways to deal with the issue of sensitivity. One is to be aware 
of it and accept the (hopefully, small) probability that the results are potentially wrong. The other 
is to modify the method to make it robust against such deviations. Population closure is 

11 
 
considered unlikely in practice and hence methods are being developed that are robust against 
this assumption. Single-visit (SV) method replaces the population closure assumption with the 
RSPF condition. Generalized (or dynamic) N-mixture method (DM; Dail & Madsen 2011) 
replaces the population closure assumption by explicitly modeling the population changes from 
one time point to other. Both these assumptions are liable to fail. For example, underlying 
population changes occur on continuous time scale and there are many different mechanisms. 
DM models the population change on discrete time scale and with a particular form of transition 
matrix. There is no way to check the appropriateness of this discrete time population transition 
model given the observed data. If it is not appropriate, DM will lead to biased estimates. It is 
simply unrealistic to make statistical methods robust against every possible model 
misspecification. It is an occupational hazard that any time a statistical method is used to analyze 
real data, there is always a (hopefully small) possibility that the true data generating mechanism 
is such that assumptions are not satisfied and hence the results are completely wrong. 
Sensitivity of the generalized N-mixture method to scaled probability link 
K&K show that when detection probability is modeled as scaled logistic, the SV leads to 
biased estimators. K&K, citing Zipkin et al. (2014), suggest that the generalized N-mixture 
model might have numerical issues under the standard models. However, the behaviour of the 
model was not studied using scaled link functions. To fill this gap, we present a simulation study 
to better understand the behaviour of DM under various situations. We conducted the simulation 
study so that the stated assumptions of the DM are fully satisfied. We follow the models and 
notation described in Dail and Madsen (2011). We used two continuous covariates that affected 
abundance and two continuous covariates that affected detectability. In one setup there was no 
overlap between the abundance and detection covariates. In the other setup, the covariates were 

12 
 
overlapping: one of the continuous covariates affected both abundance and detection. For the 
transition parameters, we used constant ‘arrival’ 𝛾= 1 and constant ‘survival’ 𝜔 values (𝜔 
ranged from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1). The assumption that transition parameters do not depend on 
covariates is not realistic. It implies that as time passes, the abundances are less affected by the 
covariates. However, when these parameters do depend on covariates, the estimation procedure 
is extremely slow and extensive simulations are nearly impossible to perform. Because the 
dependence on the covariates vanishes for other time points, we compared the estimated mean 
abundances under DM and SV only for the first visit where the abundances do depend on 
covariates.  We considered 200 locations and 3 replicate visits. This is a fairly large sample for 
carrying out multiple visits in practice. For smaller number of locations but more replicate visits, 
the biases are even larger. We used the ‘unmarked’ package (Fiske & Chandler 2011) to estimate 
the parameters for DM and the ‘detect’ package (Sólymos, 2012) to analyse the single-visit data. 
Reproducible R (R Core Team 2014) simulation code can be found in the Supporting 
Information. 
Let us look at the results (Figure 3) when the RSPF condition is satisfied, that is, when 
1/c = 1 (c ≥ 1 is the scaling factor in the logit link following the notation of K&K). In this case, 
both DM and SV methods are nearly unbiased. DM method exhibits increasing negative bias as 
the populations become more open (𝜔< 1) and when scaled logistic model (1/c < 1) is used for 
detection probability. In fact, if w = 0, DM likelihood is identical to the SV likelihood and 
hence, it also requires that the detection function satisfies the RSPF condition. This is reflected in 
the fact that the pattern in the DM based bias is identical to the pattern in single-visit based bias 
when the dependence between consecutive visits is weak. 

13 
 
An obvious conclusion from this simulation study is that DM is also not robust against 
the scaled logistic detection function. Of course, no simulation study can ever determine that one 
method is better than other methods under every possible scenario. We have always presented, 
and still consider, single-visit method as one of the tools in the statistical toolbox available to the 
ecologists. It is certainly an improvement over the multiple-visits N-mixture method and is 
definitely a reasonable alternative to the generalized N-mixture method when the dynamic 
parameters are unknown or when time-series data are unavailable. 
Diagnosing the presence of scaled probability links 
 
For a scientist and a statistician, a mathematical model is not simply a mathematical 
formula. A mathematical or a statistical model should represent a realistic mechanism. Neither 
K&K nor Hastie and Fithian (2013) offer a mechanism that might underlie a scaled probability 
link function. In this section, we propose a few possible mechanisms that could lead to scaled 
probability models. Furthermore, we show how single visit datasets can be used to diagnose the 
possibility of scaling in the detection function. A constant scaling model by itself is not very 
useful in practice because it does not further our understanding of the detection process. In order 
for a mathematical model to be useful, we should be able to use it not only for understanding the 
process of detection but also to use that knowledge in designing effective surveys. This suggests 
that we should try to find out if there are any covariates that affect the scaling factor. Hence we 
show how such covariates can be incorporated in the scaling component of the detection model. 
It again turns out that the RSPF condition becomes important for identifiability of covariate 
dependent scaling factors.  
A constant scaling factor in the detection function or a resource selection probability 
function may arise because of data entry errors. For example, occasionally an observer, being 

14 
 
human, might transcribe ‘absent’ even when he means to write ‘present’. Proportion of such 
random data entry errors (to be precise, 1 – proportion of errors) are represented as a constant 
scaling factor in the detection function. Although we hope such errors are infrequent in practice. 
Similarly, in telemetry studies, occasionally one may miss a GPS location completely at random; 
that is, the probability of missingness does not depend on the habitat the animal is present (Frair 
et al. 2004). Again, such errors are rare in practice but can be represented as a constant scaling 
factor in the RSPF model. It is much more likely that the probability of missingness depends on 
covariates. We will show how to deal with that case later in the section. 
We first start with an approach to diagnose the presence of a scaling factor in the 
detection function when ancillary information at a subset of locations is collected. We emphasize 
that this information can be collected during the single visit surveys without any need to revisit 
the location repeatedly. Thus logistical requirements are similar to the single visit surveys. 
Distance sampling extension of the Binomial-ZIP model 
It often happens that a subset of the data is collected using a different protocol. For 
example, when professional biologists are conducting surveys at a few locations as part of an 
otherwise volunteer based program, they may collect information about distance classes within 
which the individuals are observed. It is known that the inferences are highly sensitive to the 
correct estimation of the distances. Only a highly trained field staff can obtain reliable 
information on the distances at a subset of the locations in the larger survey. 
For this subset of the locations, the total count 𝑌𝑖 at site i is the sum of the vector 
(𝑌𝑖1, … , 𝑌𝑖𝐽) with individuals detected in different distance bands or strips (j = 1, …, J). We can 
write the following hierarchical model to allow for this stratification by distances: 
𝑁𝑖 ~ Poisson(𝜆𝑖) 

15 
 
(𝑂𝑖|𝑁𝑖) ~ Binomial(𝑁𝑖, 𝑝𝑖) 
(𝑌𝑖0, 𝑌𝑖1, … , 𝑌𝑖𝐽|𝑂𝑖) ~ Multinomial(𝑂𝑖, (𝜋𝑖0, 𝜋𝑖1, … , 𝜋𝑖𝐽)) 
Where (𝜋𝑖0, 𝜋𝑖1, … , 𝜋𝑖𝐽) is the unconditional Multinomial cell probability vector, which can be a 
function of distance (see Sólymos et al. 2013). The count 𝑌𝑖0 is not observed with a 
corresponding cell probability 𝜋𝑖0 = 1 −∑
𝜋𝑖𝑗
𝐽
𝑗=1
= 1 −𝑞𝑖. A constant truncation distance 
across the survey locations leads to constant 𝑞𝑖= 𝑞 for all locations. This Multinomial model, 
thus, corresponds to the constant scaling factor model proposed by K&K. Moreover, the 
marginal distribution of 𝑌𝑖, the total counts at the site, is a Binomial-Poisson mixture with 
detection probability 𝑝𝑖𝑞, a scaled probability function. Thus, any constant scaling of 𝑝𝑖 gets 
absorbed in 𝑞. In practice, to account for large number of zeros, it is often sensible to model 𝑁𝑖 
as a zero-inflated Poisson random variable. As in the single-visit data (Sólymos et al. 2012), it is 
known that the zero-inflation parameter and the detection error parameters tend to be 
confounded. In Appendix 1, we extend the conditional likelihood method to the Multinomial-ZIP 
model. This analysis can be conducted using the function ‘svabuRDm’ in the Supporting 
Information. 
 
Analysis of the data using only the marginal distribution of 𝑌𝑖 will lead to biased 
estimates of the intercept parameter for the abundance model. On the other hand, analysis based 
on the Multinomial model will lead to unbiased estimates of the same. Hence the analysis of 
such a subset of the data can be used to check the assumption that the detection function satisfies 
the RSPF condition. One can predict the abundances at this subset of locations using two 
methods: SV method and the Multinomial method. If the predicted abundances are substantially 
different, scaled probability function might be needed for the detection.  

16 
 
To demonstrate that our proposed Multinomial model can be used to estimate abundance 
in the presence of an unknown scaling factor, we performed a simulation study to compare the 
relative bias in abundance intercept between the 3-level Multinomial model and the single-visit 
method. We used the scaled logistic detection probability function with scaling factor q = 0.5 
corresponding to 100 m truncation distance and τ = 80 m effective detection radius. Results in 
Figure 4 indicate that the 3-level Multinomial model gives nearly unbiased abundance intercept 
values. We know that the single-visit method would lead to biased estimates of the abundance. 
The SV abundance intercept parameter shows a bias approximately equal to log(q) = log(0.5) =  
–0.69 (Figure 4). Comparison of results between the 3-level model and the single-visit model 
would alert the researcher about the need to consider a scaled logistic model. When extra 
information on the distance classes is available for a subset of locations, it is possible to exploit 
such extra information to test for scaling and use the estimates as offsets in single-visit models 
(see Sólymos et al. 2013 for a discussion of detectability offsets).  
Incorporating covariates in the scaling function 
Suppose a researcher realizes the need for incorporating a scaling factor in the detection 
function using the diagnostic tool described above or based on their understanding of the 
detection process. In our opinion, a detection function is not a nuisance parameter that only 
needs to be estimated to correct the abundance estimates. It should also be used to help design 
effective surveys in the future. A constant scaling factor is not of much use for such a purpose. 
One needs to understand why there is a scaling factor and how one can control its value and 
potentially increase the detection probability. Given the results in Welsh et al. (2013), the goal 
should be to design surveys so that detection probability is high and correcting the abundance 
estimates is less important. Hence, after diagnosing the presence of the scaling factor, one should 

17 
 
strive to model it as a function of covariates. We give an example of such a situation and show 
how to fit the scaled detection function that depends on covariates. Not surprisingly, the RSPF 
condition again becomes important for identifiability. Either the scaling function or the original 
detection function needs to satisfy the RSPF condition.  
In distance sampling, it is often assumed that the detection function takes value 1 at 
distance 0 (Buckland et al. 2001, Matsuoka et al. 2012). This has been criticized as being not 
always realistic (Johnson 2008) and one can imagine a situation where an upper limit to the 
detection probability that is smaller than 1 exists (Farnsworth et al. 2002, Sólymos et al. 2013, 
Amundson et al. 2014). It is, however, difficult to imagine that the upper limit for detection 
probability is constant under all situations. It is far more likely that the upper limit depends on 
habitat covariates or some measure of sampling effort (Reidy et al. 2011, Sólymos et al. 2013, 
Matsuoka et al. 2014, Kellner & Swihart 2014). As we show below, under this more realistic 
situation, the single-visit method leads to identifiable parameters and correctly provides 
abundance estimates. Consider a situation where we are surveying forest songbirds. Suppose 
there are
birds at a location. We can model these by the Poisson distribution (or, Negative 
Binomial or zero-inflated versions of these). Not all of them might be singing during the survey 
time interval. The birds that are singing are available for detection. This may be modeled by 
using a Binomial distribution that is related to the proportion of birds singing. Actual detection, 
however, is still imperfect because even if the bird is singing, the observer may not detect it with 
probability 1 depending, for example, on the distance between the observer and the vocalizing 
bird. This leads to another hierarchy that can be modeled by a Binomial distribution that is 
related to detection. The full model may be written as: 
𝑁𝑖 ~ Poisson(𝜆𝑖) 
N

18 
 
(𝑂𝑖|𝑁𝑖) ~ Binomial(𝑁𝑖, 𝑝𝑖) 
(𝑌𝑖|𝑂𝑖) ~ Binomial(𝑂𝑖, 𝑞𝑖) 
Notice that the distribution of the observed data given the true counts reduces to 
(𝑌𝑖|𝑁𝑖) ~ Binomial(𝑁𝑖, 𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖). If we take 𝑞𝑖= 𝑞 to be independent of any covariates, this reduces 
to the scaled detection probability mentioned by K&K. However, it is far more likely that the 
scaling factor depends on covariates. The method of conditional likelihood (Sólymos et al. 2012) 
can be extended to this case. Mathematical details are available in the Appendix 2. Analysis of 
such data can be conducted using the function ‘svabuRD’ in the Supporting Information. In 
Figure 5, we present simulation results showing that when 𝑞𝑖 depends on a covariate, such as 
point count radius, all the parameters are estimable using the single-survey. 
Conclusions 
All statistical analyses inherently depend on models and assumptions. As practicing scientists, 
we are well aware of the reality that we never know whether or not the true data generating 
mechanism satisfies these assumptions. In spite of this, we continue to use statistical methods for 
data analysis as long as the assumptions are not unrealistic. We consider the risk of being wrong 
occasionally as simply an occupational hazard.  
In this paper, we have clarified the conditions under which single-survey methodology is 
valid. We argued that the situations under which the RSPF and single-visit methodologies fail 
are rare. This is further emphasized by the lack of any references to published studies where the 
log or scaled logistic model is preferred over the commonly used link functions for the 
probability of detection. We also illustrated that the generalized N-mixture method does not 
protect against the violation of the RSPF condition. If the population is completely open (𝜔=
0), DM likelihood reduces to the single-visit N-mixture likelihood, and as such, parameters are 

19 
 
non-identifiable under the DM method unless the detection function satisfies the RSPF 
condition. We discuss various mechanisms that may lead to scaling in the detection function. We 
discuss a practical method, based only on a single visit to the survey locations, to diagnose the 
presence of a scaling factor. If the scaling factor is substantially different than 1, one may need to 
think about possible mechanisms for scaling. We showed that if the scaling factor is a function of 
covariates, single-visit methodology is useful to estimate the parameters in the scaling function. 
In practice, when designing surveys, one has to strike a balance between the increase in 
cost due to multiple-visits, possibility of failure of critical assumptions, such as independence of 
surveys and the possibility that the RSPF condition is not satisfied by the true model of detection 
when aiming to make statements about abundance and occupancy. Even a cursory look at the 
current literature suggests that the detection models that are actually used do belong to the RSPF 
model class. This fact and the breadth of the RSPF model class suggest that one may be on safe 
grounds to use single visit method for data analysis and making inferences.

Figure legends 
 
Figure 1. The variety of randomly generated linear, quadratic, and cubic response curves after 
inverse logit and cloglog transformations illustrate that the class of models that satisfy the RSPF 
condition (as described in the text) is fairly general. 
Figure 2. Complex nonlinear response functions that do not reach 1 are identifiable as long as 
the RSPF condition explained in the text is satisfied. Grey lines show results for best fit response 
curves from 100 simulations based on Resource Selection Probability Function (RSPF) model 
(left) and single-visit N-mixture model (right) using one of the cubic polynomial response 
functions (black curve) from Figure 1. Best fit curve was selected based on AIC values from 
linear, quadratic and cubic responses; cubic response was supported in 100% of the simulation 
runs. Sample sizes were: 3000 used and 30000 available points in RSPF and 1000 observations 
in N-mixture. 
Figure 3. Relative bias [(estimate – true value) / true value] in mean abundance (𝜆̅) estimates 
based on generalized N-mixture (DM) and single-visit N-mixture (SV) models as a function of 
the scaling constant (1/c) used in the scaled logistic link. Blue-to-red colored lines indicate 
different values of the survival rate (ω), models exhibited trend due to a fixed arrival rate (𝛾= 1) 
through the T = 3 repeated visits (only estimates for the first visit shown, see Supporting 
Information for R code and full set of results). The set of abundance and detection covariates 
were disjunct (top row) or included a variable in common (bottom row). Lines represent mean 
values from 120 replicates. Number of locations was 200.

Figure 4. Bias (estimate – true value) in abundance intercept sestimates based on 3-level 
Multinomial (Multinom) and single-visit N-mixture (SV). A scaling constant of q = 0.5 was used 
in the scaled logistic link for simulations. Results are based on 100 simulation runs, n = 200 
survey locations, and two distance bands (0–50 m and 50–100 m bands around points). 
Figure 5. Estimability check for the single-visit Binomial–Binomial–Poisson mixture to estimate 
parameters of three processes: population density (𝛼0, 𝛼1), singing behaviour of birds 
(availability; 𝛽0, 𝛽1), and distance related observation process (detectability; effective detection 
radius, 𝜏). Left panel shows bias for the five model parameters. The middle shows the detection 
function related to the 𝜏 parameter (black line is the true relationship, grey lines represent 
replicate runs). The bias for mean abundance (𝜆̅), mean availability (𝑝̅), and mean probability of 
detection (𝑞̅) corresponding to the three processes are shown in the right panel. Box-plots 
represent simulation results based on 100 replicates. Bias was calculated as (estimate – true 
value), relative bias was defined as [(estimate – true value) / true value].

Appendix 1 
Conditional maximum likelihood estimation of the Multinomial–ZIP model parameters 
Let us consider an extension of the single-visit abundance methodology developed in Sólymos et 
al. (2012) to the case where the scaled link function will be useful. Imagine a survey situation 
where the observer is counting birds within a specified radius circle at each survey location. The 
bird has to make an auditory or visual cue in order to be detected. This is often called availability 
for sampling (Reidy et al. 2011). One can model the availability by using the standard links such 
as logit or cloglog as a function of covariates such as time of the day, time of year, wind, 
precipitation etc. In the following, we denote this by pi, probability of availability at the i-th 
location. However, even if an individual is available for observation, it does not mean it will be 
observed. This probability may depend on how far the bird is from the observer. A common 
approach in distance sampling is to bin the detections according to distance classes. This data 
corresponds to a Multinomial distribution with counts (𝑌𝑖1, … , 𝑌𝑖𝐽) observed in different distance 
strata (j = 1, …, J) with corresponding cell probabilities (𝑝𝑖𝜋𝑖1, … , 𝑝𝑖𝜋𝑖𝐽). Availability, 𝑝𝑖, can be 
constant or a function of covariates, while 𝜋𝑖𝑗 can be a function of distance (see Royle et al. 2004 
and Sólymos et al. 2013). It is required to have at least 2 distance intervals (e.g. 0–50 m and 50–
100 m) with finite truncation distance. Because we have more information in the data when a 
single-visit count is subdivided by spatial stratification, the truncation distances (𝑟𝑖𝐽) do not need 
to vary across locations. We show that the conditional distribution of the observations given the 
total count is greater than zero does not depend on the zero inflation parameter (𝜑) of the ZIP 
abundance model. The conditional distribution may be written as: 
P(𝑌𝑖∙= 𝑦𝑖∙|𝑌𝑖∙> 0) =
P(𝑌𝑖∙= 𝑦𝑖∙)
1 −P(𝑌𝑖∙= 0) 

28 
 
where 𝑦𝑖∙= ∑
𝑦𝑖𝑗
𝐽
𝑗=1
. The probability mass function for this probability distribution is given by: 
𝑃(𝑌𝑖∙= 𝑦𝑖∙|𝑌𝑖∙> 0) =
∑

𝐽
𝑗=1
= 1 −𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖 is the corresponding cell 
probability. The derivation follows along the same lines as in Solymos et al. (2012).

29 
 
Hence, 1 −𝑃(𝑌𝑖∙= 0) = (1 −𝜑)(1 −𝑒−𝜆𝑖𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖). The Supporting Information provides code to 
simulate data under this model and estimate the parameters.

Appendix 2 
An example where scaled link function for detection probability is applicable 
Here we use a distance sampling approach similar to Appendix 1 and consider a half-Normal 
detectability function to model the effect of the distance. Following Sólymos et al. (2013), this 
probability may be modelled as the function of the point count radius (ri) and the standard 
deviation of the half-Normal distribution (τ) (see equation on p. 1050 in Sólymos et al. 2013). 
The point count radius corresponds to the survey protocol that decides the circle within which 
the observer counts the birds. This may vary from station to station or from survey to survey. 
However, it is important that it varies. We can write the marginal probability mass function as 
𝑃(𝑌𝑖= 𝑦𝑖) = ∑(𝑁𝑖
𝑦𝑖
) (𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖)𝑦𝑖(1 −𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖)𝑁𝑖−𝑦𝑖𝑒−𝜆𝑖𝜆𝑖
𝑁𝑖
𝑁𝑖!
∞
𝑁𝑖=𝑦𝑖
 
where 𝜆𝑖= 𝐷𝑖𝜋𝑟𝑖
2 and 𝐷𝑖 is the population density that we model using log-link and covariates. 
The marginal distributions under the Zero-inflated Poisson model and corresponding Negative 
Binomial models can be derived in a similar fashion. It is also trivial to extend the method of 
conditional likelihood (Sólymos et al. 2012) to this case using the fact that conditional 
distribution  𝑃(𝑌𝑖= 𝑦𝑖|𝑌𝑖> 0) is independent of the zero inflation parameter for when the 
distribution of 𝑁𝑖 is zero inflated. For example, for zero inflated Poisson model it is given by 
𝑃(𝑌𝑖= 𝑦𝑖|𝑌𝑖> 0) =
∑
(𝑁𝑖
𝑦𝑖) (𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖)𝑦𝑖(1 −𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖)𝑁𝑖−𝑦𝑖𝑒−𝜆𝑖𝜆𝑖
𝑁𝑖
𝑁𝑖!
∞
𝑁𝑖=𝑦𝑖
1 −𝑒−𝜆𝑖𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑖
 
Under the RSPF condition and provided that covariates that affect ‘p’ and ‘q’ are not completely 
overlapping, this model leads to identifiable parameters. See Lele et al. 2012 and the present 
paper for the discussion of identifiability for single-visit Binomial-Binomial mixture, which is 

31 
 
exactly the same as the piqi component discussed here. The Supporting Information provides 
code to simulate data under this model and estimate the parameters.
