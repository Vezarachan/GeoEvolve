Abstract
Urban villages (UVs), informal settlements embedded within China’s urban fabric, have
undergone widespread demolition and redevelopment in recent decades.
However, there
remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effec-
tively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelop-
ment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning–based framework
to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmenta-
tion of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV bound-
aries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the “re-
mained–demolished–redeveloped” phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction
sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China’s four eco-
nomic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central),
Xi’an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes
were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral
areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal trans-
formation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual
optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear
nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive plan-
ning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the
findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustain-

1. Introduction
With the rapid acceleration of global urbanization, informal settlements have become a
critical challenge for sustainable urban development. Known internationally as slums (Li
et al., 2023), favelas (Carvalho and de Carvalho Cabral, 2021), or shantytowns (Li et al.,
2018), these areas are typically characterized by informal construction, inadequate infras-
tructure, and unclear legal status (UN-Habitat, 2004). The United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) emphasize the need to improve the living conditions of residents
in such settlements and promote their integration into formal urban systems (UN-Habitat,
2023). Achieving this requires accurate mapping of their spatial distribution and temporal
evolution (Breuer et al., 2024).
In the context of China’s urbanization, informal settlements are primarily represented
by urban villages (UVs)—rural enclaves embedded within expanding urban built-up areas
(Liu et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2025). Rooted in the persistence of collective rural land own-
ership, UVs have long existed outside formal urban planning and governance frameworks,
resulting in unregulated growth and inadequate public services (Chen et al., 2022; Tu et al.,
2024). Combined with high population mobility and fragmented socio-spatial structures,
these conditions have given rise to persistent informality, functional disorder, and height-
ened social vulnerability (Cao et al., 2025). Despite these challenges, UVs play a critical role
in providing affordable housing for migrant workers and low-income groups (Jin et al., 2024),
making their governance crucial for promoting urban equity, social inclusion, and sustainable
development.
Since the early 2000s, large-scale UV redevelopment began in China, primarily through
demolition and real estate-led reconstruction to enhance land value (Wu and Han, 2025).
Although this model has yielded short-term economic gains and visual improvements, sys-
tematic evaluations of post-demolition land-use transformation and utilization efficiency re-

main limited. Moreover, concerns over long-term sustainability, equity, and social inclusion
have sparked growing criticism of this economically driven model (Li et al., 2021; Chen
et al., 2023). In recent years, as China’s urbanization enters a phase of stock-based renewal,
UV redevelopment has not only regained policy attention but also expanded into a nation-
wide agenda 1. New strategies now prioritize livelihood improvement, moderate demolition,
and context-sensitive interventions to stabilize the housing market and support sustainable
transformation (Shen et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2024). However, despite the scope and speed of
these transformations, a fundamental knowledge gap remains: we still know relatively little
about what happens to UVs after demolition. Are they swiftly rebuilt into new residential
or public services? Are they left vacant? These post-demolition trajectories critically affect
housing equity, spatial efficiency, and redevelopment success, yet they are seldom systemat-
ically monitored or evaluated. This gap poses urgent challenges for both academic research
and urban governance, underscoring the need for scalable and evidence-based approaches to
monitoring UV demolition and redevelopment.
1.1. Related work in mapping and monitoring urban villages
Advances in geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the study
of UVs using multi-source spatiotemporal data (Cao et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2025). Compared
with traditional land surveys, deep learning methods can extract complex spatial features
from large-scale remote sensing imagery and support dynamic change detection and analy-
sis across broad spatial and temporal ranges. Despite these promising developments, cur-
rent research still faces major challenges: 1) difficulties in developing standardized mapping
methods, 2) limited efforts in long-term and cross-regional monitoring, and 3) insufficient
understanding of post-demolition transformation and redevelopment outcomes (Cao et al.,
2025).
The first challenge lies in the spatial heterogeneity of UVs and the resulting difficulty in
developing standardized mapping methods. Accurately mapping the spatial extent and tem-
poral transformation of UVs is foundational to understanding their evolutionary dynamics
1The State Council of the People’s Republic of China. (2024, November 15). Policy Support for Urban

and supporting effective redevelopment (Cao et al., 2025). Current UV mapping relies heavily
on very-high-resolution remote sensing (VHR-RS) imagery (e.g., Google Earth, Gaofen-2),
often with spatial resolutions below 3 meters, and in some cases reaching sub-meter levels
(Gao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2021). To reflect heterogeneity and functional characteristics,
researchers increasingly incorporate socially sensed data, such as street view imagery, points
of interest (POIs), mobile phone signals, and shared bike trajectories (Chen et al., 2022; Li
et al., 2025b; Tu et al., 2024). While these data enrich functional understanding, cross-city
applications remain hindered by high acquisition costs, inconsistent quality, and the absence
of standardized data fusion protocols. In addition, the vast geographic span of China gives
rise to significant regional variations in UV morphology (as illustrated in the study area
example in Figure 2), further complicating efforts to develop a one-size-fits-all identification
strategy. Against this backdrop, VHR-RS imagery combined with deep learning has become
a more feasible and unified pathway for scalable and temporally consistent UV monitoring.
The second challenge stems from the limited spatiotemporal scope of most existing UV
studies. Early efforts typically focused on static, single-city mapping of UVs using manual or
rule-based methods. With the increasing availability of VHR-RS imagery and the evolution
of deep learning models, recent work has moved toward more automated and scalable ap-
proaches. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures now enable
end-to-end recognition with enhanced precision (Wei et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2020; Fan et al.,
2022; Zhang et al., 2024). However, the spatial application of these models has largely re-
mained concentrated in very limited cities with well-developed data infrastructures, such as
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Beijing (Cao et al., 2025). As methodological systems matured
and data coverage expanded, only recently have studies begun expanding the study area
(Chai et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2025; Tu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025a; Lin et al., 2024). Tem-
porally, UV mapping is also evolving from single-year snapshots toward dynamic multi-year
monitoring (Huang et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2024). Despite recent advances, existing stud-
ies remain limited in short-term and city-specific analyses, lacking systematic examination
across broader spatial and temporal scales.
The third challenge is the lack of fine-grained assessments of land use transition and rede-
velopment efficiency following UV demolition. While earlier study has described general pat-
4

terns of UV transformation at the district level (Wei et al., 2023), few have interpreted land
reuse pathways or evaluated actual outcomes at a broader scale. Such detailed assessments
are technically demanding, as demolition and redevelopment often progress asynchronously,
producing transitional landscapes with blurred boundaries and mixed-use patterns that are
difficult to classify (Cao et al., 2025). In addition, inconsistencies in the quality of VHR-RS
imagery—caused by seasonal variability, uneven lighting, and occlusions from shadows or
clouds—further complicate analysis (Rolf et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2021).
To address these challenges, a dynamic monitoring framework is needed to capture the full
transformation cycle, from demolition to redevelopment, while maintaining both semantic
clarity and temporal adaptability. In response, this study develops a deep learning framework
using VHR-RS imagery to map UVs over time and monitor their post-redevelopment land-
use transitions across regions. Specifically, we train deep learning models on baseline imagery
and apply it to subsequent years to ensure spatial consistency. The resulting change areas are
further attributed to functional types using POIs and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Without
requiring multi-temporal training or domain adaptation, this framework achieves a balance
between spatial accuracy and meaningful functional interpretation. It provides a scalable
and cost-efficient solution for long-term and cross-region monitoring of UV transformation,
enabling more informed and adaptive urban planning.
To reflect regional diversity and
variations in redevelopment practices, four major cities representing China’s four economic
divisions are selected: Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi’an (West), and Harbin
(Northeast).
The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:
• We propose a deep learning-based framework for dynamic mapping and spatiotemporal
monitoring of UVs, enabling scalable, cross-regional, and long-term monitoring of UV
transformation;
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically quantify the
vanishing and transformation of UVs across multiple Chinese mega-cities, mapping
their spatial restructuring patterns and revealing redevelopment efficiency;
• Through a comparative analysis, we identify three distinct post-demolition land-use
5

transformation patterns: synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and
gradual optimization.
This typology reveals the fragmented and non-linear nature
of UV transformation, and offers empirical evidence to inform differentiated planning
strategies and policy-making for informal settlement governance.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the study area
and data. Section 3 presents the proposed framework for UV spatiotemporal change analysis.
Section 4 reports and analyzes the results, offering both qualitative and quantitative insights
into the spatiotemporal dynamics of UVs. Section 5 discusses research limitations and policy
implications. Section 6 concludes the paper with the main contributions and findings.
2. Study area and data
2.1. Study area
Rapid urban expansion in China has driven the large-scale emergence and evolution
of UVs, marked by spatial, functional, and social transformations shaped by diverse so-
cioeconomic and developmental contexts (Li et al., 2025b). Despite common origins, their
trajectories diverge notably across regions due to varying structures and strategies. This
study selects Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Xi’an, and Harbin as the study areas (see Figure 1),
based on the following criteria: 1) Representativeness: All four cities are rapidly developing
provincial capitals with pronounced UV issues, spanning across different city tiers, including
first-tier, new first-tier, and second-tier; 2) Regional coverage: The selected cities represent
China’s four major economic regions 2, i.e., East (Guangzhou), Central (Zhengzhou), West
(Xi’an), and Northeast (Harbin); 3) Diversity: The cities include old industrial cities, trans-
port hub cities, and emerging urban centers shaped by post-reform development, allowing
for comparison across different urbanization trajectories; 4) Redevelopment stages: The four
cities vary in their timing, pace, and intensity of UV redevelopment.
In delineating the study areas, this research focuses on the core built-up zones of each city
and further refines the boundaries based on administrative divisions and urban development

contexts. Specifically, Guangzhou’s study area includes the four central districts: Liwan,
Yuexiu, Haizhu, and Tianhe.
For Zhengzhou, the area within the Fourth Ring Road is
selected, encompassing Zhongyuan, Erqi, Jinshui, Guancheng Huizu, and Huiji districts.
Xi’an and Harbin are defined by their respective ring expressways. Xi’an’s study area includes
the core urban districts of Beilin, Xincheng, Lianhu, Weiyang, Yanta, and parts of Baqiao,
while Harbin’s area includes Daoli, Nangang, Daowai, and Xiangfang districts. To further
contextualize spatial heterogeneity, typical UVs are visually examined using remote sensing
and street view imagery (see Figure 2), revealing notable differences in spatial boundaries,
surrounding environments, and building forms.
2.2. Data sources
This study integrates multi-source data to analyze the spatial distribution of UVs, land
use change, and assess the spatial impacts of redevelopment. As summarized in Table 1, the
data sources include VHR-RS imagery, village name, road network, and POI data. VHR-
RS imagery from Google Earth (approximately 0.5 m resolution) was used for mapping
UV boundaries and detecting temporal changes. Imagery years were chosen based on two
criteria: major redevelopment policy milestones (see Section 5.3) and image availability

and quality. Although remote sensing imagery often contains clouds and building shadows,
we ensured that the selected images were clear overall and that the affected areas did not
overlap with UVs, thereby minimizing potential quality issues in subsequent analysis. Two
time-series spans were constructed: 2015, 2019, and 2023 for Guangzhou and Xi’an (8 years);
2009/2010, 2016, and 2022 for Zhengzhou and Harbin (13 years). We also used the catalog of
village names, consolidated from local government public information and field research, to
assist in the labeling of the training data for deep learning models. Road network data from
OSM, including highways and urban roads, were employed to delineate study boundaries
and analyze spatial patterns. Socially sensed data such as POIs has proven valuable for
attributing functional meaning to land-use transitions (Liu and Biljecki, 2022). In this study,
POI data from Amap (a.k.a. Gaode Maps), covering commercial, residential, educational,
medical, and transport categories, support functional classification (Tu et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2025b).
Based on the POIs attributes, we constructed a redevelopment classification to
capture land-use transformation outcomes.

3. Methodology
This section elaborates on the proposed framework for mapping the dynamic spatial ex-
tent and land use changes of UVs. As illustrated in Figure 3, it includes three steps: 1)
Data collection and preprocessing.
This step integrates multi-source datasets to build a
high-quality annotated dataset for deep learning model training. 2) UV mapping. Deep
learning–based semantic segmentation models are applied to multi-temporal remote sens-
ing imagery, with model optimization and morphological post-processing used to enhance
boundary precision and temporal consistency. 3) Spatiotemporal change analysis. Based
on the identified UVs, this step recognizes the land-use types of the demolished UV areas,
categorizes transformation pathways, and employs spatial statistics to reveal UV evolution
patterns across the study area. The details of each step are elaborated in the following
subsections.
3.1. Urban village data collection and preparation
10

The foundation of the framework lies in the construction of a high-quality labeled dataset
that can support robust model training and evaluation. This process began with the careful
selection of imagery years, where policy relevance, image quality, and sample availability
were jointly considered. For Xi’an and Guangzhou, imagery from 2019 was selected as it
represented the mid-stage of redevelopment, when UVs remained abundant and morpholog-
ically distinct. In Zhengzhou, imagery from 2009 captured the early redevelopment stage
before widespread clearance, while in Harbin, imagery from 2010 provided the earliest reliable
baseline prior to large-scale demolition.
Training samples were labeled after the team established a shared understanding of UV
characteristics across the four cities through studying and discussing their background and
typical forms. Once the temporal baseline was determined, candidate UVs were first located
from geocoded government-published name lists with satellite imagery, then refined using
street view image data, village boundary maps, and user-contributed place names from
Amap. Cases with blurred boundaries or complex morphologies were resolved through group
consensus and, when necessary, validated by field checks. Sampling was distributed across
subregions (east, west, south, north, central) to capture intra-city variation. Final labeling
was independently performed by two members with cross-checking, followed by a third-
member review, with each labeler spending approximately 8–10 person-hours per city.
Given the inherent spatial autocorrelation and temporal dependency of remote sensing
data (Karasiak et al., 2022), conventional random sampling often inflates accuracy and un-
derestimates generalization error (Sun et al., 2023; Rolf et al., 2024). To reduce label leakage
and mitigate overfitting, we adopted geographical blocking and spatial buffering strategies
(Ploton et al., 2020). Geographical blocking partitions the study area into non-overlapping
units and assigns entire units exclusively to training or validation, while spatial buffering
establishes exclusion zone around validation samples and removes nearby training samples,
thereby ensuring spatial independence between the two sets (Roberts et al., 2017). In ad-
dition, validation sites were carefully selected to include diverse UV morphologies, such as
compact clusters embedded in high-rise districts and fringe settlements adjacent to farmland.
Finally, imagery was preprocessed into 1024×1024 pixel tiles with 512-pixel overlap to

enhance sample diversity and segmentation smoothness. As presented in Table 2, the labeled
dataset was divided into training and validation sets with a ratio of 80:20, with a roughly
balanced ratio of positive to negative pixels (1:1). To provide a clearer sense of scale, the
total UV area covered by the training and validation samples in each city is also reported.
3.2. Urban village mapping based on semantic segmentation
With the dataset prepared, deep learning-based semantic segmentation models can be
trained to map UVs across urban areas. To improve generalizability and precision, we com-
pared three semantic segmentation models widely used for UV mapping across-regions: U-
Net, DeepLab-v3+, and UV-SAM. These models represent different segmentation strategies
tailored to the unique challenges posed by UVs, such as irregular boundaries, varying scales,
and heterogeneous forms:
• U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) adopts a symmetric encoder–decoder architecture
with skip connections to preserve fine-grained spatial features, making it suitable for
high-resolution image segmentation tasks;
• DeepLab-v3+ (Chen et al., 2018) leverages atrous convolution and atrous spatial pyra-
mid pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale contextual information, thereby enhancing
segmentation robustness in complex environments;
• UV-SAM (Zhang et al., 2024) integrates the state-of-the-art SegFormer with SAM to
first produce coarse masks and then refine boundaries via SAM for enhanced accuracy.
Model training was performed on the labeled dataset, with hyperparameter tuning (e.g.,
learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) used to optimize convergence and stability.
12

Training minimized the segmentation loss, while validation performance was assessed using
standard metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), UV-specific IoU (UV-
IoU), recall (UV-Recall), and precision (UV-Precision). To further evaluate the cross-domain
generalization capability of each model, we additionally constructed a mixed-city dataset by
sampling data from the four cities in equal proportions. This dataset was used for both train-
ing and validation to simulate cross-domain scenarios, and the mean IoU on the validation
split (Mixed regions-mIoU) served as an indicator of model adaptability across heteroge-
neous urban environments. As the primary goal was accurate boundary delineation, the
final model selection was based on performance metrics rather than architectural differences.
For each city, the best-performing model was applied to multi-temporal imagery to support
large-scale UV mapping.
To ensure accurate spatiotemporal change detection analysis, a post-processing pipeline
was implemented to refine the model outputs. Morphological closing was first applied to fill
small gaps and enhance boundary continuity, followed by opening operations to eliminate
noise and smooth object contours (Chen et al., 2022). Next, temporal alignment of UV
boundaries was conducted by comparing outputs across years with reference maps to main-
tain geometric consistency and minimize spatial misalignment caused by temporal offsets,
sensor variation, or model bias. Finally, manual verification was conducted to correct false
positives and negatives, producing a reliable and consistent UV boundary dataset.
3.3. Spatiotemporal land use change recognition and analysis
To investigate the physical transition and functional restructuring pathways of UVs dur-
ing urban renewal, this study employs a three-stage lifecycle framework comprising Re-
mained, Demolished, and Redeveloped stages (as shown in Figure 3(c)). Drawing upon the
“maintain, demolish, and re-purpose" transformation logic proposed by Johnson et al. (2014),
this study applies a post-classification approach to spatiotemporal change detection, in which
multi-temporal images are segmented independently and their classification results are com-
pared at the pixel level to identify changes (Shi et al., 2020). This method incorporates
UV boundaries confirmed each year, enabling consistent and interpretable tracking of their
lifecycle transitions across space and time.
13

The classification primarily relies on UV boundaries extracted from high-resolution re-
mote sensing imagery captured at three observation periods (T1, T2, and T3). Parcels con-
sistently identified as UVs throughout all observation years were classified as Remained. In
contrast, parcels detected in earlier periods (T1 or T2) but absent in the most recent period
(T3) were categorized as Demolished, with their spatial extents (DBT3) computed as:
DBT3 = (BT1 ∪BT2) −BT3
(1)
where BT1, BT2, BT3 refers to the spatial extent (boundaries) of detected UVs in study year
T1, T2, T3, respectively. Further, demolished parcels redeveloped into stable urban functions
by the year T3 are classified as Redeveloped.
To characterize the nuanced transformations following UV demolition, we further subdi-
vide the Demolished and Redeveloped stages into six mutually exclusive land-use categories:
Incomplete demolition, Vacant land, Construction sites, Buildings, Green Spaces, and Oth-
ers (see Table 3). These land-use categories encompass the entire transformation process
from transitional to fully functional states, thereby forming an operational and generalizable
spatiotemporal classification system.
Specifically, incomplete demolition refers to parcels significantly reduced in size by T3,
yet not completely cleared. Vacant land and construction sites, typically lacking explicit
POIs or OSM tags, are identified using spectral and textural features derived from remote
sensing imagery.
Vacant land generally displays homogeneous bare surfaces with sparse
vegetation (Mao et al., 2022), whereas construction sites exhibit irregular reflectance patterns
accompanied by machinery and temporary structures (Wu et al., 2024a).
To accurately
classify these transitional land-use types, we employ a ResNet model (He et al., 2015),
which is known for its effective extraction of deep image features due to its residual learning
architecture.
For redeveloped parcels, semantic assignment is conducted through the integration of
POIs data and OSM layers. Residential, commercial, or office uses are classified as buildings;
parks and landscaped areas as green spaces; and roads, plazas, or public infrastructure
as others.
Notably, parcels demolished from UVs rarely convert directly into single-use
categories but often evolve into mixed-use spaces. To ensure accuracy, we implement detailed
14

spatial clipping for these parcels. In areas with overlapping categories, the classification relies
on the dominant pixel-based land-use type, supplemented by manual verification to maintain
spatial exclusivity and semantic consistency.
Following classification, we quantify the area associated with each land use type and
develop a transition matrix to examine spatiotemporal dynamics. These metrics reveal how
clearance and redevelopment processes differ across cities and offer insights into broader
patterns of land restructuring in post-demolition contexts.
4. Results and analysis
4.1. Urban village mapping
4.1.1. Model performance evaluation
Table 4 summarizes the segmentation performance of three models across the four cities.
UV-SAM outperformed its counterparts in Zhengzhou and Harbin, achieving the highest
mIoU scores of 90.30 and 85.77, respectively. It also recorded superior UV-IoU and UV-
Precision, reflecting robust delineation of UV boundaries and effective suppression of false
positives.
In Xi’an, UV-SAM yielded high precision but slightly lower recall than DeepLab-v3+,
suggesting reduced sensitivity to fragmented or peripheral UV patterns. In contrast, DeepLab-
v3+ performed best in Guangzhou, achieving an mIoU of 85.28 and the highest UV-Recall
(86.01), demonstrating better coverage in densely built environments. U-Net, while showing
the highest UV-Precision in Harbin (92.00) and Guangzhou (91.14), consistently lagged in
UV-IoU and recall, indicating its limited ability to capture complete UV extents.
City-level comparisons further reveal that Zhengzhou exhibited the most balanced per-
formance across all models, reflecting clear UV boundaries and high-quality training data.
Harbin also showed strong results, particularly under UV-SAM. Conversely, Xi’an recorded
the lowest overall accuracy, likely due to image quality, complex urban morphology, or shadow
interference. In Guangzhou, while recall was high, the model tended to over-predict in dense
areas, leading to slightly lower precision.
Notably, models trained on Mixed-Cities datasets consistently underperformed their city-
specific counterparts, with mIoU scores typically 0.1 to 2.5 points lower. This underscores
15

current limitations in cross-city generalization and reinforces the necessity of localized train-
ing strategies when mapping UVs with pronounced morphological diversity (Yu et al., 2025).
4.1.2. Spatiotemporal dynamics of urban village extent
Figure 4 illustrates the spatiotemporal dynamics of UV distribution in the study area.
While all four cities experienced a reduction in total UV area, the pace and magnitude
of decline varied substantially. In Guangzhou, the UV area decreased only slightly from
24.59 km² in 2015 to 24.05 km² in 2023. This modest change suggests a gradual and adaptive
redevelopment strategy that likely aims to minimize disruptions to local communities and
economic activity. In contrast, Zhengzhou underwent the most substantial transformation.
The UV area declined from 38.56 km² in 2009 to 6.35 km² in 2016, and further to 1.95 km²
by 2022. This reduction of over 90 percent within thirteen years indicates a strong emphasis
on concentrated clearance and extensive spatial restructuring.
Xi’an and Harbin exhibited distinct temporal patterns. In Xi’an, UV transformation
progressed slowly in the early stage, with area decreasing from 28.70 km² in 2015 to 27.92 km²
in 2019. By 2023, however, the area had declined sharply to 14.91 km², representing nearly
a 50% reduction compared to 2015.
Harbin, by contrast, experienced more rapid early
reductions, with UV area shrinking from 32.21 km² in 2010 to 24.79 km² in 2016, followed
by a slower decrease to 20.06 km² by 2022.
These results highlight not only the varying pace and extent of UV redevelopment across
cities, but also prompt a critical question: what types of land use have replaced the demol-
ished UVs, and to what extent have these areas been reintegrated into the broader urban
fabric? The following section addresses this issue in detail.
4.2. Land-use transformation of urban villages
4.2.1. Overview of land-use changes after urban village demolition
Demolished and incomplete demolition parcels of UVs were identified through spatial
differencing of multi-temporal UV boundaries. Redeveloped categories, including buildings,
green spaces, and others, were determined through the overlay of POIs and OSM data.
Vacant land and construction sites, as transitional types, were classified using a ResNet18

model trained on 250 manually labeled image patches, achieving F1-scores of 0.94 and 0.88,
respectively.
At the city scale, as shown in Figure 5(a), redevelopment trajectories of UVs demon-
strate strong spatial heterogeneity. In cities with a longer observation window (2009–2022),
Zhengzhou features high-intensity redevelopment, though many parcels remain underuti-
lized; Harbin also implemented substantial redevelopment, but its northeastern outskirts
still contain large vacant zones, indicating delayed spatial stabilization. In contrast, cities
with shorter timeframes (2015–2023) present distinct strategies: Xi’an concentrated rede-
velopment along the second and third ring roads, with a high proportion of construction
land, reflecting synchronized demolition and rebuilding. In contrast, Guangzhou pursued
small-scale, dispersed redevelopment within the urban core, reflecting an incremental and
adaptive renewal strategy. Notably, across all four cities, many of the demolished UV sites
coincide spatially with newly constructed road networks, indicating that clearance activi-
ties have contributed to the expansion of transport infrastructure and the reconfiguration of
urban spatial structures, thereby improving inter-neighborhood connectivity.
Figure 5(b–j) present representative cases of current land uses on previously demolished
UV sites across the study cities, tracing their respective transformation pathways. Most
cases exhibit a sequential progression—from incomplete demolition, through vacancy or con-
struction phases, to eventual redevelopment.
However, the pace, allocation, and spatial
configuration of these transformations vary considerably among cities, shaped by differences
in governance capacity, planning orientation, and market dynamics. In the early stage, some
sites remain in a state of incomplete demolition. For instance, the Jujiazhuang site in Xi’an
(Figure 5.b) showed signs of incomplete demolition as early as 2019, yet remained substan-
tial building remnants by 2023, indicating stalled redevelopment. Fully demolished sites
generally fall into two transitional categories: vacant and construction sites. Zhangzhai Vil-
lage in Zhengzhou (Figure 5.c) remained vacant between 2016 and 2022, suggesting delayed
follow-up investment; in contrast, Xishitou Village in Guangzhou (Figure 5.d) entered the
construction phase promptly, reflecting a clear development path and high implementation
efficiency.
Several sites have been fully transformed into developed urban functions. In Harbin and

and Zhengzhou’s Guangjing Green Slope (Figure 5.g, 5.h) highlight the ecological direction
of land redevelopment. Infrastructural redevelopment is illustrated by the Nongye Elevated
Road in Zhengzhou and a public parking facility in Xi’an (Figure 5.i, 5.j).
4.2.2. Quantitative analysis of urban village transformation
To analyze post-demolition transformations of UVs, we generated land use transition
maps at the sub-district (Jiedao) level across the four cities (Figure 6). Combining Sankey
diagrams with 3D bar visualizations, the results reveal notable divergences in redevelopment
tempo, spatial response, and functional transition pathways.

mations at the sub-district level, with bar height representing the area of land use change. The location of each bar corresponds to the centroid of the
respective sub-district. Note that each city adopts a different vertical scale, as indicated in the legends. Thick black lines in the base maps denote
major urban ring roads. The Sankey diagrams on the right illustrate the temporal flow of land use transitions, where the initial value corresponds to
the total urban village area in the baseline year (T1).

Redevelopment Pace. Zhengzhou and Harbin underwent early large-scale demolition,
reducing the share of UV area to 5.06% and 62.27%, respectively. However, persistently
high vacancy rates (25.76%, 17.75%) suggest a significant gap between clearance and rede-
velopment. Xi’an exhibited stronger coupling between demolition and construction, with
the proportion of UVs dropping to 51.95% and over 20% of land transitioning to building or
construction use. In contrast, Guangzhou maintained relatively stable share of UV area and
vacancy rates below 1%, reflecting a restrained, low-intensity approach.
Spatial Patterns. All cities followed a common pattern of core stability and peripheral
transformation. Most changes occurred beyond the third ring road. Zhengzhou and Harbin
developed extensive vacant and construction zones along the urban fringe—indicative of
inefficient development belts. Xi’an showed coordinated redevelopment along transporta-
tion corridors, while Guangzhou’s changes were more scattered and localized, with minimal
disruption to the existing urban fabric.
Functional Transitions. Cities also diverged in land-use priorities. Xi’an prioritized
construction, with limited ecological or service-oriented reallocation. Zhengzhou remained
33.77% of the land for building, while allocating 5.43% to green spaces and 12.52% to other
infrastructure; 16.26% remained under construction. Harbin increased ecological space but
showed limited construction momentum. Guangzhou preserved its original land-use pattern,
indicating the mildest transformation.
The analysis results and visualizations underscore that UV redevelopment is a prolonged
and often fragmented process, with few cleared areas achieving stable land use even after
four to six years—highlighting the delayed spatial stabilization following demolition. This
pattern reflects the nonlinear and asynchronous nature of UV transformation, where dif-
ferences in redevelopment pace, spatial configuration, and functional restructuring reveal
varying capacities for resource absorption, market activation, and policy execution. Particu-
larly under large-scale demolition scenarios, spatial clearance frequently outpaces land reuse,
posing challenges for long-term planning efficiency and urban equity.

5. Discussion
This study was motivated by the lack of systematic and scalable tools to monitor the
vanishing and transformation of UVs amid China’s shift toward more sustainable and inclu-
sive urban development. By leveraging multi-temporal satellite imagery and deep learning
techniques, we developed a framework to identify, quantify, and compare UV redevelopment
across four mega-cities. This section discusses the methodological reliability, spatial and
functional transition patterns, and broader policy implications, and proposes directions for
more socially responsive urban renewal.
5.1. Accuracy and reliability of the dynamic urban village mapping results
The generalizability and adaptability of deep learning models remain critical challenges in
the detection of informal settlements, especially within complex urban environments. This
study conducted empirical evaluations across four major Chinese mega-cities representing
different economic regions and urban contexts. Among the three segmentation models tested,
UV-SAM exhibited superior performance in most cases, although its accuracy was relatively
lower in Guangzhou. This suggests that current algorithms still face limitations in adapting
to heterogeneous UV morphologies and spatial textures (Yu et al., 2025).
Another significant challenge lies in distinguishing UVs from historical and cultural dis-
tricts, which often share similar spatial characteristics such as high density, low-rise struc-
tures, and irregular morphology. Figure 7 shows a typical example from the Lianhu Historical
and Cultural District in Xi’an. Previous studies have noted that models sometimes misclas-
sify these areas as UVs, and attributed such errors to the limited quality of satellite imagery
(Zhang et al., 2024). To avoid such misidentification, we excluded all officially designated
heritage zones based on local government planning boundaries 3 and extensive field verifica-
tion. This refinement significantly enhanced the semantic consistency and policy relevance

of our results. The findings highlight that improving classification accuracy requires not
only algorithmic refinement, but also a nuanced understanding of the planning semantics
embedded in local spatial governance.
Furthermore, although our model did not detect
large-scale UV demolition in Guangzhou, this should not be interpreted as a lack of urban
renewal activities. As a national pioneer in incremental regeneration, Guangzhou has pri-
oritized micro-scale improvements and community-level upgrading over wholesale clearance
(Liu et al., 2025). These subtle transformations are often difficult to capture through con-
ventional satellite imagery, indicating the need for future research to integrate additional
features, such as building height, roof material, and street-level visual data, to better detect
and interpret fine-grained urban changes.
To analyze post-demolition redevelopment, we developed a land-use classification schema
grounded in the degree of utilization rather than conventional functional zoning (Cao et al.,
2020). Instead of assigning plots to fixed categories such as residential or commercial, we de-
lineated three progressive stages—remained, demolished, and redeveloped—further divided
into six subtypes: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction site, building, green
26

spaces, and others. This typology enables a more dynamic, process-oriented understanding
of UV transformation and reflects both physical and functional changes over time.
Despite its advantages, this classification approach is subject to several uncertainties.
First, semantic interpretation of land-use types is affected by the cultural and institutional
contexts of different cities—what appears to be a vacant lot in Xi’an may, in fact, be under
archaeological protection rather than representing inefficient land use. Second, the classifica-
tion model relies heavily on publicly available datasets and visual interpretation, which may
not always reflect real-time land-use transitions. Ambiguities frequently arise in transitional
zones, such as those between green spaces and construction, or temporary structures and
permanent buildings, increasing the interpretive burden and classification instability.
5.2. From vanishing to transformation: a critical phase
5.2.1. Vanishing: displacement, housing loss, and urban inequality
The vanishing of UVs is not merely a matter of physical erasure—it is the quiet unraveling
of deeply rooted communities that once sheltered the city’s most mobile, yet most vulnerable,
residents. For decades, UVs have provided essential housing for low-income and migrant
populations in Chinese cities. However, despite their crucial social function, they have often
been stigmatized due to the complex social issues they are seen to represent (Jin et al., 2024).
Under the framework of SDG 11, many cities have launched UV redevelopment initia-
tives. Yet “vanishing” goes beyond demolition, it marks a rupture in housing provision and
institutional support. Without adequate resettlement and policy safeguards, such clearance
risks amplifying spatial injustice and social exclusion. In cities like Zhengzhou, redevelop-
ment has proceeded swiftly and at scale. As detailed in Section 4.2, mass demolitions were
completed rapidly, yet functional replacements lagged significantly, leaving one-quarter of
cleared sites vacant. These “urban scars” reflect both inefficient land use and the emergence
of new social and safety risks (Garvin et al., 2013).
More critically, the loss of UVs undermines affordable housing stock and disrupts migrant
residents’ social networks (Lin et al., 2025; Li et al., 2021). Displaced populations are often
pushed to more peripheral or equally unstable settlements, perpetuating cycles of forced
relocation and insecure tenure (Ye et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). For example, according
27

to Zhang (2015), Zhengzhou’s demolition of UVs affected approximately 700,000 migrant
workers. However, the combination of soaring housing prices, a shortage of public rental
housing, and an increasingly tight rental market forced many migrants to relocate frequently
4. Some rural migrants were ultimately pushed out of the city altogether. This undermines
both social equity and labor accessibility. To further capture how these processes were per-
ceived at the public level, we employed the official Weibo AI Search service 5 to analyze
discussions on UV demolition in Zhengzhou (details can be found in Supplementary Ap-
pendix A.1). As one of China’s largest social media platforms with broad penetration across
user groups, Weibo provides a reliable source for gauging public sentiment (Shi et al., 2022),
and the AI Search service systematically retrieves and aggregates relevant posts. The results
indicate that public discourse primarily centered on three themes: (1) the disappearance of
low-rent housing following the intensive wave of demolitions around 2016; (2) long delays
in the delivery of resettlement housing, which increased household financial burdens; and
(3) the recent implementation of “housing voucher resettlement” schemes and the allocation
of national redevelopment funds, which have sparked debates over insufficient compensa-
tion, limited housing choices, and extended resettlement cycles. These voices reflect the
profound impacts of UV demolition on residents’ lives. They also highlight blind spots in
post-demolition processes, particularly the overlooked spaces that shape resettlement expe-
riences.
One critical overlooked aspect concerns the dynamics of informal resettlement sites that
emerge following UV clearance. These areas, often excluded from formal planning frame-
works, accommodate displaced migrant tenants and other non-owner residents who previ-
ously relied on UVs for affordable housing. As they are typically formed outside official relo-
cation schemes, such spaces play a pivotal role in shaping the lived experiences and spatial
trajectories of vulnerable populations. Mapping and monitoring these “hidden geographies”
could offer critical insights for promoting equitable urban development and addressing the
blind spots of post-demolition resettlement (Gao et al., 2018).

5.2.2. Transformation: delayed redevelopment and green resilience potential
The transformation of UVs reflects broader shifts in urban dynamics rather than mere
technical or logistical challenges. Historically, UVs emerged as a byproduct of China’s rapid
urban expansion (Cao et al., 2025), bridging gaps between formal planning and actual urban
growth. However, as many Chinese cities now confront slowing growth or even population
decline (Zou et al., 2025), the underlying logic driving redevelopment is shifting.
This transition is particularly evident in cities such as Harbin and Zhengzhou. As dis-
cussed in Section 4.2.2, although large-scale demolitions have been completed, many cleared
sites remain either vacant or delayed in prolonged construction processes. In Harbin, va-
cant land constituted 47% of all cleared UV parcels by 2022—the highest proportion among
the four cities. This situation reflects broader structural constraints in Northeast China,
where economic decline and demographic shrinkage have undermined both fiscal capacity
and market confidence (Tong et al., 2021). In Zhengzhou, aggressive clearance campaigns
were implemented early, yet limited follow-up planning and weak institutional coordination
have resulted in widespread underutilization. These cases challenge the conventional as-
sumption that demolition will naturally lead to timely redevelopment. UVs are increasingly
suspended between the retreat of expansion-driven planning and the unrealized vision of
renewal.
Despite these challenges, the transformation of UVs holds significant spatial potential.
While some parcels are repurposed for housing, transportation, or utilities, integrating green
spaces provides a cost-effective and flexible strategy for climate resilience (Zhang et al.,
2025). Green infrastructure has been shown to mitigate urban heat island effects, improve
microclimates, and support public health and adaptive capacity (Wu et al., 2024b; Jin and
Li, 2024). In this study, we classified green spaces as a separate category to quantify its
proportion among transformed sites. Our findings suggest that several cities are proactively
expanding ecological networks, signaling a more resilient approach to spatial redevelopment.
Importantly, many UV areas coincide with zones of heightened climate vulnerability
(Elmarakby and Elkadi, 2024; Chen et al., 2025). A comparison between identified UVs in
Xi’an and the mapped distribution of urban heat island intensity and climate inequality (Xu
et al., 2024) reveals substantial spatial overlap. In addition, inadequate drainage and poor
29

waste management have made these areas highly susceptible to flooding (Sakijege et al.,
2012; Chen et al., 2025; Balderas Torres et al., 2020).
In cases of in-situ upgrading or
incremental renewal, as opposed to wholesale demolition, strengthening basic infrastructure
remains essential. Targeted improvements in drainage, green cover, and public space can
significantly strengthen these communities’ capacity to cope with extreme weather events.
5.3. Governance evolution and implementation gaps
As highlighted earlier, UV redevelopment in China is deeply shaped by national and
local policies that coordinate spatial planning, population resettlement, and infrastructure
provision. Policy orientations not only guide implementation strategies but also shape the
governance logics and spatial outcomes across different cities. This section traces the evolu-
tion of key policies from 2002 to 2024 (as shown in Figure 8), highlighting a trajectory from
land-driven restructuring toward more holistic approaches emphasizing sustainable urban
renewal and territorial governance over the two decade’s rapid urbanization in China.
At the national level, the inclusion of UVs in the official shantytown redevelopment agenda
30

in 2013 marked a turning point, elevating their governance to a priority issue. Since 2021,
the policy direction shifted from large-scale demolition and reconstruction to urban renewal.
This new approach emphasizes preservation, improvement, and organic transformation. In
2023 and beyond, the central government further clarified the spatial scope and distribution
of UVs. It also expanded the renovation target to more than 300 prefecture-level cities,
marking a new phase of area-wide UV governance.
At the city level, the policy shifts of UV redevelopment varied considerably across cities,
and their implementation trajectories vary considerably. Guangzhou was among the earliest
cities to prioritize the urban renewal of UVs, upgrading the “Three-Old” redevelopment
strategy (targeting old towns, villages, and factories) to urban renewal in 2015. Between
2015 and 2023, the spatial patterns of Guangzhou’s UVs remained relatively stable. In 2024,
the city enacted the Regulations on UVs Renovation, institutionalizing its micro-renewal
strategy through a formal legal framework. In contrast, Zhengzhou pursued a high-intensity
clearance model.
In 2016, Zhengzhou announced plans for the large-scale demolition of
approximately 350 UVs, but by 2022 had shifted toward an urban renewal governance model
emphasizing the improvement of remaining villages.
Between 2009 and 2016, the urban
village area in Zhengzhou declined sharply, followed by a continued decrease from 2016 to
2022. However, as shown in Sections 4 and 5.2.2, this approach resulted in substantial tracts
of idle land and delayed functional replacement, undermining resettlement effectiveness. In
2018, Xi’an set the goal of eliminating all UVs within its expressway ring by 2020, and in 2021
introduced urban renewal regulations. Between 2019 and 2023, the total area of UVs in Xi’an
declined substantially. Owing to its distinctive historical legacy as an old industrial base,
Harbin initiated shantytown redevelopment relatively early. In 2016, it announced plans
to basically complete the redevelopment of shantytowns, UVs, and dilapidated housing by
2020, and in 2021 launched targeted renewal projects for key areas. Between 2010 and 2016,
Harbin’s UVs decreased significantly, with the pace of reduction slowing between 2016 and
2022.
Despite continued progress across cities, several implementation challenges remain. First,
ambitious demolition targets often exceed the actual governance and fiscal capacity of local
authorities, resulting in stalled or partial completion.
Second, an overemphasis on land
31

consolidation, fiscal returns, and development indicators tends to marginalize the needs of
low-income residents, migrant workers, and other vulnerable groups.
Current strategies
often lack differentiated responses in resettlement, housing affordability, and community
continuity, resulting in growing socio-spatial fragmentation and eroding urban inclusivity.
5.4. Research limitations and future directions
This study has several limitations that warrant further improvement. Technically, three
key challenges remain. First, although the deep learning framework performs well in UV
boundary mapping, it lacks end-to-end automation, which increases the difficulty in scaling
the method to broader space and time. Second, while remote sensing captures large-scale
morphological changes, it fails to reflect fine-grained functional attributes and governance
details. Integrating additional data sources such as street view imagery could enhance spatial
resolution and contextual accuracy. Third, no segmentation model proved universally effec-
tive due to significant morphological variation between northern and southern cities. Scaling
to national-level monitoring is hindered by high computational demands and extended infer-
ence times. These issues may introduce errors in UV boundary mapping and post-demolition
land use classification, yet still offer meaningful insights into broader spatial transformation
trends. Additionally, the limited availability of VHR-RS imagery prevented full temporal
alignment across the four study areas, which constrained the consistency of cross-city com-
parisons. Nonetheless, this constraint also enabled the study to incorporate both long-term
(13 years) and short-term (8 years) observation windows, offering complementary temporal
perspectives.
Despite these limitations, the proposed framework also has potential applications in other
national contexts with informal settlements such as slums or favelas. While Chinese UVs dif-
fer in morphology and institutional context, informal settlements worldwide often share key
physical features in remote sensing imagery, including high density, small roof sizes, irregular
layouts, and sharp contrasts with surrounding formal areas (Kamalipour and Dovey, 2019).
Building on these shared characteristics, our technical pipeline integrates multi-temporal
VHR-RS imagery, OSM and POI data, semantic segmentation models, and post-classification
land-use analysis, which together offer a relatively low-cost and adaptable approach. In addi-
32

tion, the lifecycle perspective of “remained, demolished, and redeveloped” provides a broadly
applicable analytical lens to understand both the vanishing and transformation of informal
settlements. Admittedly, cross-national applications still face challenges such as variations
in data availability, differences in the semantic interpretation of land-use transitions, and
divergent governance contexts. Addressing these challenges requires incorporating locally
specific data sources, calibrating classification schemes to reflect cultural and functional nu-
ances, and fostering collaborations with local researchers and practitioners (Kohli et al.,
2016; Rafieian and Kianfar, 2023). Future research should therefore empirically test and
refine the framework in diverse Global South contexts to evaluate its robustness, scalability,
and policy relevance for informal settlement governance.
From a governance perspective, future efforts should center on three key shifts: systematic
policy evolution, a deeper understanding of transformation drivers, and tiered intervention
mechanisms in the Chinese context. Amidst slowing real estate growth (Wang and Tian,
2024), transitioning from indiscriminate demolition toward socially regenerative approaches
is imperative. This paradigm shift necessitates balancing spatial optimization with socioeco-
nomic equity while leveraging urban re-planning opportunities to address demographic shifts
and climate pressures. A comprehensive understanding of transformation drivers, including
policy, economic, social, and demographic factors (Gao et al., 2023; Rafieian and Kianfar,
2023), is essential for designing effective and context-sensitive governance strategies. Future
work should incorporate quantitative approaches to assess the relative influence of these
factors across different spatial and institutional contexts. To support targeted action, we
advocate establishing a tiered classification system based on locational attributes, functional
typology, cultural significance, and resident demographics to categorize informal settlements
into demolition-redevelopment, micro-regeneration, and preservation-enhancement. This ap-
proach clarifies intervention priorities and sequencing, thereby improving policy precision
and resource allocation.
These coordinated technical and governance advancements ultimately aim to achieve dual
objectives: optimizing spatial structures while stabilizing social foundations, thus steering
urban renewal toward high-quality, sustainable, and human-centered development.

6. Conclusion
Amidst global efforts to improve informal settlements under the United Nations’ SDG
11 and China’s renewed emphasis on UV renovation, this study offers a critical and cross-
regional reflection on UV redevelopment practices in China. It provides valuable insights
into the transformation patterns and associated land-use changes.
Specifically, by integrating high-resolution remote sensing imagery with deep learning–based
segmentation models, we systematically mapped the disappearance and redevelopment of
UVs nearly fifteen years across four representative cities in China’s major economic regions,
i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi’an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The
analysis identifies three predominant land-use transition pathways following demolition: syn-
chronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization. Each pattern
reflects differing spatial strategies and governance capacities. These findings underscore the
mismatch between demolition cycles and actual land redevelopment, which can lead to spatial
inefficiencies and increase the risk of social displacement. Furthermore, we have established
a scalable and transferable framework for monitoring the dynamics of urban informal settle-
ments through multi-source geospatial data. It also provides planning insights that support
context-sensitive strategies to balance spatial restructuring with social equity, especially in
the context of slowing urban expansion and rising demands for sustainable reconstruction.
Future research can incorporate multi-perspective datasets with higher spatial and tem-
poral resolution to explore the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of UV redevelop-
ment. A tiered governance approach can help enhance the effectiveness, resilience, and equity
of urban renewal. Collectively, these contributions not only inform policy development in
China but also offer globally relevant knowledge for managing the redevelopment of informal
settlements.
