Introduction
The variational approximation method has been proved to be a convenient non-
perturbative approximation method for both the quantum mechanical and quan-
tum ﬁeld theoretic systems.
The method, which was originally developed for a
non-perturbative evaluation of quantum mechanical energy eigenvalues, has been
extended to an action principle by Jackiw and Kerman1, which enables one to com-
pute the eﬀective actions for time-dependent systems and also for quantum ﬁeld the-
ories. The usefulness of the method for quantum ﬁeld theories, however, is limited
by the fact that only the Gaussian functional and it’s obvious generalizations can be
used as trial wave functionals, which is the reason why it is often called the Gaussian
approximation. Attempts to improve the Gaussian approximation by using more
general non-Gaussian trial wave functionals have not been as fruitful as expected,
due to the diﬃculties in solving the variational gap equations2. To overcome such
limitations the authors of Ref.[3] has developed the so-called post-Gaussian expan-
sion method, which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction terms to
the Gaussian eﬀective potentials for the time-independent systems.
It is the purpose of this note to give a brief review of the variational approxi-
mation method in quantum ﬁeld theory, and to present a new systematic method
of perturbative expansion around the Gaussian eﬀective action based on the back-
ground ﬁeld method, which is also applicable to the time-dependent systems.
The variational method in quantum mechanics is based on the fact that the
ground state energy is the minimum of the expectation values of the Hamiltonian
of the system. This can be written as a variational principle,
δΨ < Ψ| ˆH( ˆQ, ˆP) −λ|Ψ >= 0,
(1)
where ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the system and |Ψ > is an arbitrary state. If one
starts from a trial wave function with variational parameters, then Eq.(1) provides
a variational approximation of the energy eigenstates.
This simple variational method can be generalized to include the information
on the time-evolution of the system, by choosing the state to satisfy the constraints,
< Ψ|Ψ > =
1
< Ψ| ˆQ|Ψ > = q(t)
(2)
< Ψ| ˆP|Ψ > = p(t).
Minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to such states,
δΨ < Ψ| ˆH( ˆQ, ˆP)|Ψ >= 0,
(3)
we obtain the eﬀective Hamiltonian,
Heff(q, p) =< Ψ0| ˆH( ˆQ, ˆP)|Ψ0 >,
(4)
where |Ψ0 > is the solution of Eq.(3). This eﬀective Hamiltonian provides many
useful informations on the quantum system. If one minimizes Heff with respect to
2

the variations of q(t) and p(t), one obtains the ground state energy eigenvalue of
the system. If one solves the Hamilton’s equation, on the other hand,
˙q(t)
=
∂Heff
∂p
(5)
˙p(t)
= −∂Heff
∂q
,
the solution q and p give the quantum mechanical informations on < Ψ0| ˆQ|Ψ0 >
and < Ψ0| ˆP|Ψ0 >, respectively.
If we set ˙q = 0 = p in Eq.(2), we obtain the eﬀective potential,
Veff(q) = Heff(q, p)|p=0.
(6)
If one starts from a trial wave function which satisﬁes Eq.(2), then one obtains
the variational approximation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian or the eﬀective potential.
This simple argument is in fact a part of the quantum action principle in the
Schr¨odinger picture called the action principle of Dirac1,4. This formulation can be
generalized to the case of quantum ﬁeld theory, which is the functional Schr¨odinger
picture formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory4.

Functional Schr¨odinger picture representation of quantum ﬁeld the-
ory and the variational method.
2.1
Schr¨odinger picture representation of scalar ﬁeld theory
The scalar ﬁeld theory is deﬁned by the Lagrangian density,
L = 1
2(π ˙φ −φ ˙π) −H[φ, π],
(7)
and the equal-time commutation relations
[φ(x), π(x′)]x0=x′0
= iδ(⃗x −⃗x′)
(8)
[φ(x), φ(x′)]x0=x′0
=
0 = [π(x), π(x′)]x0=x′0,
where H[φ, π] = 1
2π2 + V (φ) is the Hamiltonian density.
As in the quantum mechanical case, we choose the basis vectors for the Schr¨odinger
representation to be the eigenstates of the ﬁeld operator φ(x),
φ|ϕ(⃗x) >= ϕ(⃗x)|ϕ(⃗x) >,
(9)
which satisfy the orthogonality relation and the completeness relation,
< ϕ|ϕ′ >= δ[ϕ(⃗x) −ϕ′(⃗x′)]
(10)
Z
Dϕ|ϕ >< ϕ| = I.
3

Then the state of the physical system is represented by the component, Ψ[ϕ, t] =
< ϕ|Ψ >, of the expansion,
|Ψ >=
Z
Dϕ|ϕ >< ϕ|Ψ >,
(11)
and the operators are represented by the matrix elements,
< ϕ|φ|ϕ′ > = ϕ(⃗x)δ[ϕ −ϕ′]
(12)
< ϕ|π|ϕ′ > = −i
δ
δϕ(⃗x)δ[ϕ −ϕ′],
which are obtained from the matrix elements of Eq.(8). The time-evolution of the
system is then determined by the functional Schr¨odinger equation,
i d
dtΨ[ϕ, t] = < ϕ|H[φ, π]|ϕ′ >< ϕ′|Ψ >
= H[ϕ, −i δ
δϕ]Ψ[ϕ, t].
(13)
This is a simple generalization of the Schr¨odinger picture representation of quantum
mechanics to the case of the systems with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
2.2
Free Scalar ﬁeld theory
To obtain physical information in the Schr¨odinger picture formulation one has to
solve the functional Schr¨odinger equation (13). As an example of solving the equa-
tion of motion, we consider the free scalar ﬁeld theory described by the Hamiltonian
density,
H = 1
2π2 + 1
2(∇φ)2 + 1
2m2φ2.
(14)
By using the representation (12), the Hamiltonian of the system can be written as
H = 1
2
Z
d3x[−
δ
δϕ(⃗x)
δ
δϕ(⃗x) −ϕ(⃗x)(∇2 −m2)ϕ(⃗x)].
(15)
Since the Hamiltonian has no explicit time-dependence, there exist stationary
states satisfying the energy eigenvalue equation,
H[ϕ, −i δ
δϕ]Ψ[ϕ] = EΨ[ϕ],
(16)
where E is the energy eigenvalue. Since the Hamiltonian (15) is quadratic in ϕ(⃗x),
the Gaussian functional
Ψ[ϕ] = e−1
2
R
d3xd3x′ϕ(⃗x)G(⃗x,⃗x′)ϕ(⃗x′),
(17)
is a solution of (16). Substituting (17) into (16), we obtain.
1
2[G(⃗x, ⃗x′) −ϕ(⃗x)G2(⃗x, ⃗x′)ϕ(⃗x′) + ϕ(⃗x)(−∇2 + m2)ϕ(⃗x)]Ψ[ϕ] = EΨ[ϕ],
(18)
4

where the repeated arguments imply the integration over the variables. For this
equation to be true for all eigenvalue ϕ(⃗x), the following relations must be satisﬁed,
E = 1
2T rG =
1
2
Z
d3xG(⃗x, ⃗x)
(19)
G2(⃗x, ⃗x′) =
(−∇2 + m2)δ(⃗x −⃗x′).
Solving the second equation of (19) via Fourier transformation, one ﬁnds the kernel
of the Gaussian functional (17) is given by
G−1(⃗x, ⃗x′) =
1
(2π)3
Z
d3pei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗x′)
1
p
⃗p2 + m2 ,
(20)
which is the propagator of the free scalar ﬁeld theory at equal-time. From this the
eigenvalue E is found to be
E = 1
2
1
(2π)3
Z
d3x
Z
d3p
p
⃗p2 + m2,
(21)
which is the well-known zero-point energy of the free scalar ﬁeld theory.
We thus ﬁnd that the ground state of the free scalar ﬁeld theory is described
by the Gaussian wave functional with the kernel given by the inverse propagator at
equal-time. One can construct all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by considering
the creation and annihilation operators. They are given by the Hermite polynomial
functionals multiplied by the ground(vacuum) state5.
For the interacting theory, however, we cannot solve the functional Schr¨odinger
equation (13) in closed form. One thus has to use an approximation method to
ﬁnd solutions to the equation of motion. A natural way to evaluate an approximate
solution to (13) in the Schr¨odinger picture is to use the variational method, which
is the subject of the next subsection.
2.3
Gaussian approximation of φ4 theory
To illustrate the variational approximation method in quantum ﬁeld theory, we now
consider the scalar φ4 theory described by the Hamiltonian density,
H = 1
2π2 + 1
2(⃗∇φ)2 + 1
2µ2φ2 + λ
4!φ4,
(22)
and compute the Gaussian approximation of the eﬀective potential6. To do this we
take as a trial wave functional the solution of a free ﬁeld theory discussed in the
last subsection, namely, the Gaussian wave functional,
Ψ[ϕ, t] = Ne−1
4 [ϕ(⃗x)−ˆφ]G−1(⃗x,⃗x′;t)[ϕ(⃗x′)−ˆφ]+ i
¯h ˆπ(⃗x,t)[ϕ(⃗x)−ˆφ]
(23)
which satisﬁes the constraints,
< Ψ | Ψ > =
1
< Ψ | φ | Ψ > =
ˆφ(⃗x, t)
(24)
< Ψ | π | Ψ > =
ˆπ(⃗x, t).
5

Since the eﬀective potential is the eﬀective Hamiltonian with vanishing mo-
menta, we set ˆπ equal to zero and consider the space-time independent ˆφ. Then the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the trial state(23) is given by
< H > =
Z
d3x

V (ˆφ) + ¯h[1
8G−1(⃗x, ⃗x) −1
2∇2G(⃗x, ⃗x′)|⃗x=⃗x′
+ V (2)(ˆφ)G(⃗x, ⃗x)] + ¯h2
8 V (4)(ˆφ)(G(⃗x, ⃗x))2

,
(25)
where V (ˆφ) = µ2
2 ˆφ2 + λ
4! ˆφ4 is the classical potential and V (n)(ˆφ) = ( d
d ˆφ)nV (ˆφ).
The variational equation,
δG < H >= 0,
(26)
yields the variational gap equation,
1
4G−2(⃗x, ⃗x′) = [−∇2 + V (2)(ˆφ) + ¯h
2 V (4)(ˆφ)G(⃗x, ⃗x)]δ(⃗x −⃗x′).
(27)
Substituting(27) into (25) one obtains the eﬀective potential,
Veff(ˆφ) = 1
2µ2 ˆφ2 + λ
4!
ˆφ4 + ¯h
4 G−1(⃗x, ⃗x) −¯h2
8 G(⃗x, ⃗x)G(⃗x, ⃗x).
(28)
The ﬁrst three terms Eq.(28) constitute the one-loop eﬀective potential, and the
last term contains the higher-loop contribution, which shows the non-perturbative
nature of the approximation.
Using the Fourier transformation method we can solve the gap equation(27):
G(⃗x −⃗x′) =
Z
d3p
(2π)3 ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗x′)

p
⃗p2 + m2 ,

⃗p2 + m2 .
(30)
Substituting these results into (28) yields the eﬀective potential:

The eﬀective potential (31) has two divergences, I1 and I2(M), and thus we
need to renormalize the theory. The renormalization conditions can be written as

(37)
This result is qualitatively equivalent to the large-N approximation (where N is
the number of the scalar ﬁeld components)7, and shows the non-perturbative nature
of the approximation. The result (36) can be used to study the quantum nature
of the theory, such as the symmetry breaking phenomena6. The method can be
generalized to the case of the ﬁeld theories in curved space8, to the ﬁnite temperature
quantum ﬁeld theory9, and also to the systems out of thermal equilibrium10.
2.4
Fermionic theory
Finding the Schr¨odinger picture representation of fermion ﬁelds is non-trivial since
the equal-time anti-commutation relation, in Hermitian representation,
{ψα(x), ψβ(x′)}x0=x0′ = δαβδ(⃗x −⃗x′),
(38)
implies that the ﬁeld operators ψ’s are their own momentum conjugates. In the
non-Hermitian representation, on the other hand, the anti-commutation relation is
given by
{ψα(x), ψ†
β(x′)}x0=x0′ = δαβδ(⃗x −⃗x′),
(39)
but now the eigenstates of ﬁeld operators do not form an orthonormal basis. One
can show, however, that there exists a one parameter family of equivalent represen-
tations of fermion ﬁelds4. Floreanini and Jackiw11, in particular, have found that
the representation,
ψ =
1
√
2[θ(⃗x) +
δ
δθ†(⃗x)]
(40)
ψ† =
1
√
2[θ†(⃗x) +
δ
δθ(⃗x)],
7

where θ(⃗x) is a complex Grassmann variable, satisﬁes the anti-commutation relation
(39).
Using this representation one can follow the same procedure as in the case of
the scalar ﬁeld theory to evaluate the Gaussian approximation of the Fermionic ﬁeld
theories.
This method has been applied to the cases of (1+1)-dimensional and (2+1)-
dimensional Gross-Neveu models12, and found that the results are qualitatively
equivalent to those of the large-N approximation. It has also been applied to the
(2+1)-dimensional Thirring model, and in this case the Gaussian result has been
found to be qualitatively better than the large-N approximation13. The Gaussian
eﬀective potential shows the existence of the symmetry breaking in the theory, while
the large-N does not. The method has also been found to be eﬀective in determining
the existence of the bound states in the theory14.
3
Beyond Gaussian approximation?
We have shown that the Gaussian approximation based on the functional Schr¨odinger
picture formulation is a simple generalization of the quantum mechanical varia-
tional method, and provides a convenient non-perturbative approximation method
for various quantum ﬁeld theories including the systems out of thermal equilibrium.
However, the method has a serious drawback in that, unlike the quantum mechan-
ical cases, one can compute the expectation value of the quantum ﬁeld theoretic
Hamiltonian only for the Gaussian wave functional and its simple generalizations.
If one could develop a systematic method to compute the correction terms to
this approximation, therefore, the variational method would become a very powerful
technique in obtaining physical information from quantum ﬁeld theories. In fact
there have been some attempts in this direction recently.
One of such attempts, known as the post-Gaussian approximation method or
the variational perturbation theory3, is based on the observation that the Gaussian
wave functional
Ψ0 = e−1
4 ˜ϕ(⃗x)G−1(⃗x−⃗x′) ˜ϕ(⃗x′)
,
˜ϕ = ϕ −ˆφ
(41)
is a vacuum state for a free theory with mass given by
m2 = µ2 + λ
2
ˆφ2 + λ
2
Z
d3p
(2π)3 g(p),
(42)
where g(p) is determined by the variational gap equation (29) and (30).
One can construct all the eigenstates of this free theory:
Ψn[ ˜ϕ] = Hn[ ˜ϕ]Ψ0[ ˜ϕ]
,
n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·
(43)
where Hn[ ˜ϕ] is the Hermite polynomial functional. One splits the Hamiltonian as
H = H0 + HI
(44)
where H0 is the free Hamiltonian with the mass m given by Eq.(42) and HI is the
remaining part of H, and then applies the well known perturbation theory with the
states (43) taken to be the basis for the perturbation.
8

The eﬀective potential is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with the
constraint
< Ψ0|φ|Ψ0 >= ˆφ,
(45)
where |Ψ0 > is the ground state of the system.
Taking the eigenstates (43) to be the basis for perturbative expansion, the
eﬀective potential can be written as
Veff(ˆφ) = E0(ˆφ) +
∞
X
n=0
< Ψ0|ΨI

1
E0 −H0
HI
n
|Ψ0 >,
(46)
where the ﬁrst term is the Gaussian eﬀective potential and the second term repre-
sents the perturbative correction terms3. This method has been used to compute
the ﬁrst non-trivial contribution to the Gaussian eﬀective potential for the (0+1)-
dimensional φ4 theory by Jeon15 and the (1+1)- and (2+1)-dimensional φ4 theories
by Cea and Tedesco3.
This method provides a conceptually simple procedure to compute the order-
by-order correction terms to the Gaussian eﬀective potential for time-independent
systems. For the time-dependent systems such as those out of thermal equilibrium10,
however, we need a method that can deal with the eﬀective action, which contains
information on the time-evolution of the system.
It is the subject of the next
section to introduce a new systematic expansion method for eﬀective action, which
was developed by Geon Hyoung Lee16.
4
The Background ﬁeld method
We now introduce a systematic method which enables one to compute the order by
order correction terms to the Gaussian approximation of the eﬀective action, that
contains the information on the time-evolution of the system. This new method is
based on the background ﬁeld method. So we will start to give a brief review on
the background ﬁeld method17.
4.1
Background ﬁeld method
The generating functional for the connected Green’s functions, W[J], is deﬁned by
the path integral,
eiW[J] = N
Z
DφeiS[φ]+iJφ,
(47)
where S[φ] is the classical action, and the integral convention, Jφ ≡
R
dnxJ(x)φ(x)
in n-dimensional space-time, is used in the exponent. The eﬀective action Γ[φ] is
then deﬁned by the Legendre transformation,
Γ[ϕ] = W[J] −Jϕ,
(48)
where ϕ(x) is the vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld operator,
ϕ(x) =< φ(x) >J=
δ
δJ(x)W[J].
(49)
9

The background ﬁeld method is one of the most eﬀective ways of computing the
eﬀective action in the loop expansion, and is obtained by introducing the background
ﬁeld B(x) to the classical action:
S[φ] →S[φ + B].
(50)
This deﬁnes a new generating functional,
ei ˜
W[J,B]
= N
Z
DφeiS[φ+B]+iJφ
= N
Z
Dφ′eiS[φ′]+iJ[φ′−B].
(51)
Eg.(51) implies that this new generating functional is related to the old one by
˜
W[J, B] = W[J] −JB,
(52)
and the vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld operator in the presence of the back-
ground ﬁeld is given by,
˜ϕ = δ ˜W
δJ = ϕ −B.
(53)
Now consider the case when the vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld operator
in the presense of the background ﬁeld, ˜ϕ, vanishes:
δ ˜W
δJ = ˜ϕ = 0.
(54)
This determines the conﬁguration of J which extremizes the generating functional
˜W[J, B]:
J = J[B].
(55)
Then one can easily show from Eq.(52) that the extremum value of the generating
functional ˜W becomes the eﬀective action:
˜W[J, B]| ˜ϕ=0 = W[J(B)] −J(B)B = Γ[B].
(56)
The simpler way to compute the eﬀective action Γ[B] is to consider the Legendre
transformation of ˜
W[J, B]:
˜Γ[ ˜ϕ, B] = ˜W[J, B] −J ˜ϕ,
(57)
which generates the one ˜ϕ-particle irreducible diagrams in the presence of the back-
ground ﬁeld. If we set ˜ϕ = 0 in Eq.(57), we ﬁnd that
˜Γ[ ˜ϕ, B]

˜ϕ=0
=
˜W[J(B), B] −J ˜ϕ

˜ϕ=0
=
Γ[B].
(58)
This implies that the eﬀective action Γ[B] consists of one ˜ϕ-particle irreducible
bubble diagrams with no external ˜ϕ-lines. Thus one can write the eﬀective action
as
eiΓ[B] = ei ˜
W [J,B]
˜ϕ=0 = N
Z
DφeiS[φ+B]+iJφ

˜ϕ=0
.
(59)
10

To illustrate how the method facilitates the computation of the eﬀective action,
we now consider the scalar φ4 theory as an example. The Lagrangian density of φ4
theory can be written as
L(φ) = −1
2φ(∂2 + µ2)φ −λ
4!φ4 ≡−1
2φ(iD−1)φ −λ
4!φ4,
(60)
where D is the free propagator deﬁned by
D ≡i(∂2 + µ2)−1.
(61)
The shifted Lagrangian is then given by
L(φ + B) = −i1
2BD−1B −λ
4!B4 −i(BD−1 −i λ
3!B3)φ −1
2φiK−1φ −λ
3!Bφ3 −λ
4!φ4,
(62)
where K is the new propagator,
K = i(∂2 + µ2 + λ
2 B2)−1,
(63)
which includes a part of the interaction eﬀect through the term proportional to
B2. The generating functional in the presence of the background ﬁeld can then be
written as,
ei ˜
W[J,B] = N det(−K)
1
2 e

2 BD−1B−iλ
4! B4e(BD−1−iλ

δ

3! B(

4! (
δ

(64)
The eﬀective action for the scalar φ4 theory now becomes
eiΓ[B] = ei ˜
W [J,B]
˜ϕ=0 = Ne
1
2 BD−1B−iλ
4! B4 det(−K)

3! B( δ
iδJ )3 −iλ
4! ( δ
iδJ )4]e
1
2 JKJ

˜ϕ=0
.
(66)
The coeﬃcient of I0[B] in Eq.(65) represents the one-loop eﬀective action, and
I0[B] represents the higher loop contributions to the eﬀective action.
The ﬁrst
factor of Eq.(66) constitutes a shift operator, which does not change the extremum
value of ˜W[J, B]. Thus this factor, which generates the tadpole diagrams, does not
contribute to the eﬀective action , and we can neglect it . One can therefore write
I0[B] as
I0[B] = exp[−iλ
3! B( δ
iδJ )3 −iλ
4! ( δ
iδJ )4]e
1
2 JKJ

˜ϕ=0
(67)
which implies that the higher loop contributions to the eﬀective action consist of
one ˜ϕ-irreducible bubble diagrams with no external ˜ϕ-lines. One can compute the
higher loop contributions by the Feynman rules:
11

q
q
= K =
i
∂2+µ2+ λ
2 B2

= −iλ
: propagator
: 3-vertex
: 4-vertex
One can easily show that the two-loop contribution to the eﬀective action con-
sists of two bubble diagrams with no external lines17:
Γ(2)[B] =
K
K
-i λ
-i
-i λ
λB

.
(68)
Comparing this with the conventional method of computing the eﬀective action,
one can easily convince oneself that the background ﬁeld method provides a very
simple and eﬀective way to compute the eﬀective action in the loop expansion.

Expansion around the Gaussian eﬀective action
The reason why the procedure of computing the eﬀective action in the background
ﬁeld method is simpliﬁed is that the propagator used in the Feynman rules, Eq.(63),
includes a part of the interaction eﬀect through the background ﬁeld B(x), and the
generating functional has been rearranged in such a way that the zeroth order term
in the expansion, the coeﬃcient of I0[B] in Eq.(65), is the one-loop eﬀective action.
We now want to proceed one step further and rearrange the eﬀective action
in such a way that the propagator used in the expansion would include the non-
perturbative eﬀect and the zeroth order contribution would be the result of the
non-perturbative approximation, such as the result of the Gaussian approximation.
Note that the Gaussian approximation consists of the cactus type diagrams
where an internal line comes out of a point in space-time and goes back to the
same point, such as the ﬁrst term of Eq.(68). So we need to extract such diagrams
out of the I0[B] part of the eﬀective action. To do this we examine the functional
derivatives of the generating functional e

which would appear in the expansion of I0[B]. Note that these derivatives, which
generates 2-loop and higher order contributions to Γ[B], generate the cactus type
diagrams as can be seen in Eqs.(71) and (72).
To extract such diagrams out of I0[B], we deﬁne new functional derivatives so
that the following relations satisfy:

(74)
Comparing Eqs.(71)-(72) and Eqs.(73)-(74), we ﬁnd that the primed derivatives
must be deﬁned by

(76)
Note that the primed derivatives operated on the functional e
1
2 JGJ do not generate
the cactus type diagrams that contribute to the Gaussian eﬀective action. This
implies that by using the primed derivatives one may in fact rewrite I0[B] in such
a way that all the cactus type diagrams would be included in the zeroth order term
in the expansion.
To do this we need to ﬁnd a new Green’s function G such that

(77)
where a normalization constant N ′ and a function A are to be determined. Using
the deﬁnitions (75) and (76), one easily ﬁnds G, N ′ and A that satisfy Eq.(77):

Using these results we can write the generating functional in the presence of the

(83)
In Eq.(83) we have used the fact that the shift operator, the tadpole part of the
ﬁrst line, does not aﬀect the extremum value. Note that Eq.(80), which determines
the Green’s function Gxy, is exactly the variational gap equation written in the
Minkowski space notation, and therefore the coeﬃcient of I[B] in Eq.(82) gives rise
to the Gaussian eﬀective action as we have alluded to above. Since I[B] can be
expanded as a power series in λ as is done in the conventional background ﬁeld
method, we have the perturbative expansion of the eﬀective action around the
Gaussian approximation.
The structure of I[B] is the same as that of I0[B] in Eq.(67), except that the
propagator is now replaced by Gxy and the functional derivatives are replaced by
the primed derivatives. Thus the I[B] contribution to the eﬀective action consists
of one ˜ϕ-particle irreducible bubble diagrams with no external ˜ϕ-lines, and without
the cactus type diagrams. The contributions from I[B] can therefore be evaluated
by the Feynman rules:

We have thus established the systematic method of computing the order-by-
order correction terms to the Gaussian eﬀective action.
One can easily show that the λ2 order contribution of I[B], for example, consists
of the diagrams,
I(2)[B] =
-i
λ
-i
λ
G
-i λΒ
-i λB

.
(84)
Note that the ﬁrst diagram of Eq.(68) is a cactus type diagram and does not appear
in the expansion of I[B].
4.3
Eﬀective potential
If we consider the space-time independent background ﬁeld in the above formulation,
we obtain the eﬀective potential deﬁned by
Veff(B) ≡−Γ[B]
R
dnx.
(85)
Since Gxy is a function of (x−y) for a constant B, one can solve Eq.(80) by Fourier
transformation,
G(x −y) ≡
Z
dnp
(2π)n g(p)eip(x−y).
(86)
The Green’s function Gxy in the momentum space can then be written as
g(p) =
1
i(p2 −m2
G),
(87)
where
m2
G ≡µ2 + λ
2 B2 −λ

Z

(2π)n g(p).
(88)
Note that Eq.(87) is the variational gap equation of Gaussian approximation written
in the Minkowski notation.
Up to the λ2 order contribution of I[B], the eﬀective potential is therefore given
by
Veff(B) = VG + VP ,
(89)
where
VG ≡µ2
2 B2 + λ
4!B4 −1

2 B2)2 + iTr log
√
−G,
(90)
and
VP ≡iλ2
12B2G3 −iλ2
48G4.
(91)
VG of (90) is the Gaussian eﬀective potential and VP of (91) is the ﬁrst non-trivial
contribution from I[B], which is represented by the Feynman diagrams shown in
15

(84).
This result is the same as that of Cea and Tedesco3 computed from the
variational perturbation theory mentioned earlier.
To illustrate the eﬀectiveness of the perturbative correction method, we now
consider the (0+1)-dimensional case, which is the quantum mechanical anharmonic
oscillator. It is convenient to write the Green’s function in Euclidean space which
is deﬁned by
p2 = −p2
E,
dnp = idnpE.
(92)
Then G(x, x) in Eq.(88) can be written as

(93)
and the gap equation becomes
m2 = µ2 + λ
2 B2 +

m2 .
(94)
The eﬀective potential up to the λ2 order of I[B] becomes
Veff(B) = VG + VP ,
(95)
where
VG = µ2
2 B2 + λ
4!B4 −1
2λ(m2 −µ2 −λ

and
VP = −

(97)
We can compare this result with other approximation methods. For the com-
parison of the eﬀectiveness of various approximation methods it is convenient to
compare the ground state energy eigenvalue of the anharmonic oscillator, which is
deﬁned by the minimum value of Veff. The table below shows the errors of various
approximation methods compared to the numerical results18. This shows that our

method greatly improves the Gaussian approximation even at the ﬁrst non-trivial
correction level, for all values of the coupling constant. Note that, for strong cou-
pling, the Gaussian and the improved Gaussian approximation display much better
results than the loop expansion methods, which shows the non-perturbative nature
of the approximation methods.

Conclusion
We have shown that the functional Schr¨odinger picture formulation of quantum
ﬁeld theory provides a conceptually simple non-perturbative approximation method,
namely the Gaussian approximation. It has been proved to be a reliable method to
obtain non-perturbative informations on the symmetry breaking phenomena, exis-
tence of bound states and time-evolution of the time-dependent systems with rela-
tively little computational diﬃculties. The method, however, has a serious drawback
in that it does not provide a systematic procedure to improve the approximation.
We have shown that the background ﬁeld method provides a solution to this
limitation of the variational method. We were able to rearrange the eﬀective action
in such a way that the zeroth order contribution in the expansion of the eﬀective
action consists of the Gaussian eﬀective action. This provides a new systematic
expansion method which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction terms
to the Gaussian eﬀective action.
The eﬀective potentials for the (0 + 1), (1 + 1) and (2 + 1) dimensional φ4
theory computed by the new method agree with those of the variational perturbation
theory. It has been shown that the perturbative correction greatly improves the
Gaussian approximation even at the ﬁrst non-trivial correction level. Our method
can also be applied to the time-dependent systems and can easily be extended to
the cases of fermionic and gauge ﬁeld theories.
Although the eﬀective action expanded around the Gaussian approximation for
the lower-dimensional φ4 theories can easily be shown to be renormalizable, one has
to study the renormalization procedure systematically for the (3 + 1) dimensional
case.
