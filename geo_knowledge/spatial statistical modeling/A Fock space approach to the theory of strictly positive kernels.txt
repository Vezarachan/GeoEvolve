Abstract
In this paper, we give a new approach to the theory of kernel functions. Our
method is based on the structure of Fock spaces. As its applications, various examples
of strictly positive kernel functions are given. Moreover, we give a new proof of the
universal approximation theorem for the Gaussian kernel.

Introduction
Let X be a set, and let k be a complex-valued function on X × X. Then, k is called a
kernel function if k is self-adjoint, that is, k(y, x) = k(x, y), and
n
X
i,j=1
cicjk(xi, xj) ≥0
for any n ≥1, any x1, . . . , xn ∈X and any (c1, . . . , cn) ∈Cn. In this paper, kernel functions
will be called kernels for short. Moreover, a kernel k is said to be strictly positive if
n
X
i,j=1
cicjk(xi, xj) > 0
for any n ≥1, any n distinct points x1, . . . , xn ∈X and any (c1, . . . , cn) ∈Cn\{0}. Strictly
positive kernels have received attention not only in functional analysis (see Subsection 3.2
in Paulsen-Raghupathi [7]) but also in numerical analysis (see Micchelli [5]) and machine
learning (see Guella [1]).
Now, the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method for dealing with strictly
positive kernels. Our method is based on the structure of Fock spaces induced by kernels.
1

We will apply the tensor algebra structure of the full Fock space to the theory of kernels.
This is the main idea of this paper. As consequences, we obtain not only various examples
of strictly positive kernels (Theorem 3.5 and examples in Section 4), but also a new proof of
the universal approximation theorem for the Gaussian kernel (Theorem 5.1 and Corollary
5.2).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce huge reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces from power series whose coeﬃcients are strictly positive.
Although all
materials of Section 2 are well known to specialists in Hilbert space operator theory, we will
give the details for the sake of general readers. In Section 3, we investigate relations between
the strict positivity of kernels and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces constructed in Section
2. In Section 4, various examples of strictly positive kernels are given as applications of
results obtained in Section 3. In Section 5, we prove the universal approximation theorem
for the Gaussian kernel with our method.

Preliminaries
Let k be a kernel, and let Hk be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by k. We
will use the notation kx(y) = k(y, x) throughout the whole of this paper. We ﬁx a sequence
{an}n≥0 such that an > 0 for any n ≥0 and
∞
X
n=0
an∥kx∥2n
Hk =
∞
X
n=0
ank(x, x)n < ∞
for any x in X. Moreover, we set ϕ(z) = P∞
n=0 anzn.
In this section, we construct a huge reproducing kernel Hilbert space from Hk and ϕ.
The contents of this section are well known to specialists. For example, see Exercise (k)
in p. 320 of Nikolski [6], Chapters 5 and 7 in Paulsen-Raghupathi [7] and Theorem 8.2 in
Saitoh-Sawano [8]. However, we give the details for the sake of general readers.
Let Hn
k denote the reproducing kernel Hilbert space obtained by the pull-back construc-
tion with the n-fold tensor product Hilbert space
H⊗n
k
= Hk ⊗· · · ⊗Hk
and the n-dimensional diagonal map
∆n : X →Xn, x →(x, . . . , x).
More precisely, Hn
k is equal to {F ◦∆n : F ∈H⊗n
k } as vector spaces and its inner product
is deﬁned by
⟨f, g⟩Hn
k = ⟨P(ker ∆n)⊥F, P(ker ∆n)⊥G⟩H⊗n
(f = F ◦∆n, g = G ◦∆n),
where we deﬁne ker ∆n = {F ∈D⊗n : F ◦∆n = 0} and P(ker ∆n)⊥denotes the orthogonal
projection onto the orthogonal complement of ker ∆n. Thus, we identify ∆n with the linear
2

map F 7→F ◦∆n. Then, it is easy to see that k⊗n
x
belongs to (ker ∆n)⊥. Hence, for any
function f = F ◦∆n in Hn
k, we have
⟨f, kn
x⟩Hn
k = ⟨P(ker ∆n)⊥F, P(ker ∆n)⊥k⊗n
x ⟩H⊗n
= ⟨F, k⊗
x ⟩H⊗n
= F(x, . . . , x)
= f(x).
This concludes that kn
x is the reproducing kernel of Hn
k (for the further details of this
construction, see Theorems 5.7 and 5.16 in [7]).
Next, let F denote the Hilbert space with the inner product
⟨(f0, f1, . . .)⊤, (g0, g1, . . .)⊤⟩F =
∞
X
n=0
an⟨fn, gn⟩Hn
k,
where fn and gn are functions in Hn
k, and we set H0
k = C. We consider the map Γ deﬁned
as follows:
Γ :

.
Proposition 2.1. Γ is a linear map from F to the vector space consisting of functions on
X. Moreover, ker Γ is closed.
Proof. For any F = (f0, f1, . . .)⊤in F, we have

Hence, P∞

This concludes that Γ is a linear map from F to the
vector space consisting of functions on X. Moreover, by (2.1), we have

This inequality concludes that ker Γ is closed.

By Proposition 2.1, the pull-back construction can be applied to Γ.
Deﬁnition 2.2. We deﬁne ϕ(Hk) as the reproducing kernel Hilbert space obtained by the
pull-back construction with the linear map Γ, that is, ϕ(Hk) is equal to the range of Γ as
vector spaces and its inner product is deﬁned by
⟨f, g⟩ϕ(Hk) = ⟨P(ker Γ)⊥F, P(ker Γ)⊥G⟩F
(f = ΓF, g = ΓG, F, G ∈F).
We summarize basic properties of ϕ(Hk).
Proposition 2.3. ϕ(Hk) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space consisting of functions on
X. More precisely, for any f in ϕ(Hk), there exists a vector (f0, f1, . . . , )⊤in F such that
f =
∞
X
n=0
anfn.
Moreover, the reproducing kernel of ϕ(Hk) is
∞
X
n=0
ankn
x = ϕ(kx),
that is,
f(x) = ⟨f, ϕ(kx)⟩ϕ(Hk)
for any f in ϕ(Hk) and any x in X.
Proof. We shall show that ϕ(kx) is the reproducing kernel of ϕ(Hk). If (h0, h1, h2, . . .)⊤is
a vector in ker Γ, then
⟨(h0, h1, h2, . . .)⊤, (1, kx, k2
x, . . .)⊤⟩F =

an⟨hn, kn

k =

anhn(x) = 0.
Hence, (1, kx, k2
x, . . .)⊤belongs to (ker Γ)⊥. Next, for any function f = Γ(f0, f1, f2, . . .)⊤in
ϕ(Hk), we have
⟨f, ϕ(kx)⟩ϕ(Hk) = ⟨P(ker Γ)⊥(f0, f1, f2, . . .)⊤, P(ker Γ)⊥(1, kx, k2
x, . . .)⊤⟩F
= ⟨(f0, f1, f2, . . .)⊤, (1, kx, k2

This concludes the proof.

Strictly positive kernels
In this section, we will investigate relations between the strict positivity of ϕ(k) and the
structure of ϕ(Hk). Some of results obtained in Kuwahara-S [4] are generalized into the
setting of this paper.
Lemma 3.1 ([4]). Let ψ be a function in Hk. Then, the multiplication operator Mψ with
symbol ψ is a densely deﬁned closable linear operator in ϕ(Hk). In particular, the adjoint
operator M∗
ψ is a densely deﬁned closed linear operator in ϕ(Hk), and every ϕ(kx) is an
eigenfunction of M∗
ψ. More precisely,
M∗
ψϕ(kx) = ψ(x)ϕ(kx).
Proof. We deﬁne the bounded linear operator Lψ as follows:
Lψ : H⊗n
k
→H⊗n+1
k
,
F 7→ψ ⊗F.
Then, the following diagram commutes:

where ∆n is identiﬁed with the linear map F 7→F ◦∆n. Hence, for any function fn in Hn
k,
ψfn belongs to Hn+1
k
. Let F = (f0, f1, . . . , fN, 0, . . .)⊤be a vector with ﬁnite support in F.
We set f = ΓF. Then,
ψf = ψ

where we note that ψfn−1 belongs to Hn

aN+1
ψfN, 0, . . .
⊤
,
G belongs to F and ΓG = ψf, that is, ψf belongs to ϕ(Hk). Therefore, Mψ is a densely
deﬁned linear operator in ϕ(Hk).
Moreover, it is easy to see that Mψ is closable and
M∗
ψϕ(kx) = ψ(x)ϕ(kx).
We extract the next deﬁnition and theorem from the proof of the main theorem in [4]
where exponentials of de Branges-Rovnyak kernels were discussed.
Deﬁnition 3.2 ([4]). Let Hk be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a set X. Then, X
is said to be ﬁnitely separated by Hk if, for any positive integer n and for any n distinct
points x1, . . . , xn in X, there exists a function ψ in Hk such that ψ(xi) ̸= ψ(xj) whenever
i ̸= j.
5

Theorem 3.3 ([4]). Let Hk be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a set X. If X is
ﬁnitely separated by Hk, then ϕ(k) is strictly positive deﬁnite.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that {ϕ(kx)}n
j=1 is linearly independent for any n in N and any
n distinct points x1, . . . , xn in X. Suppose that
n
X
j=1
cjϕ(kxj) = 0
for some n in N, some n distinct points x1, . . . , xn in X, and some c1, . . . , cn in C. Then,
for any function ψ in Hk, by Lemma 3.1, we have


= 0.
However, by the assumption, there exists a function ψ in Hk such that
Y
1≤i<j≤n
(ψ(xi) −ψ(xj)) ̸= 0.
Then, the Vandermonde matrix




is nonsingular. Therefore, we have that





c1ϕ(kx1)
c2ϕ(kx2)
...
cnϕ(kxn)




= 0.
This concludes that c1 = · · · = cn = 0. Indeed, if ϕ(kxj) = 0 as a function for some
1 ≤j ≤n, then we would have f(xj) = 0 for any f in ϕ(Hk). However, ϕ(Hk) includes C
by deﬁnition. Hence, ϕ(kxj) ̸= 0 for any 1 ≤j ≤n.
6

Further, in the case where ϕ(z) = ez, we have the following useful results (cf. Theorem
4.1 in Guella [1]).
Lemma 3.4. Let Hk be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a set X. If exp tk is strictly
positive deﬁnite for some t > 0, then so is exp(−t∥kx −ky∥2
Hk).
Proof. Suppose that exp tk is strictly positive deﬁnite. Then, since
exp(2t Re⟨kx, ky⟩Hk) = exp(t⟨kx, ky⟩Hk) exp(t⟨kx, ky⟩Hk)
= exp tk(x, y) exp tk(x, y),
exp(2t Re⟨kx, ky⟩Hk) is strictly positive deﬁnite by the Schur product theorem (Theo-
rem 7.5.3 in Horn-Johnson [3]). Hence, for any distinct points x1, . . . , xn in X and any
(c1, . . . , cn) in Cn \ {0}, we have
n
X
i,j=1
cicj exp(−t∥kxi −kxj∥2
Hk) =
n
X
i,j=1
cicje−t∥kxi∥2
Hke−t∥kxj ∥2
Hk exp(2t Re⟨kxi, kxj⟩Hk) > 0.
This concludes the proof.
Theorem 3.5. Let Φ be any map from a set X to a Hilbert space H. If Φ is injective,
then exp t⟨Φ(y), Φ(x)⟩H is strictly positive deﬁnite for any t > 0. Moreover, then, so is
exp(−t∥Φ(x) −Φ(y)∥2
H).
Proof. We set k(x, y) = ⟨Φ(y), Φ(x)⟩H. Then, k is a kernel. First, we shall show that
exp tk is strictly positive deﬁnite. By virtue of Theorem 3.3, it suﬃces to show that X is
ﬁnitely separated by Htk. Let x1, . . . , xn be any distinct points in X, and let M be the
subspace generated by Φ(x1), . . . , Φ(xn). Since Φ is injective, these are n distinct vectors in
H. We shall show that there exists some vector z in H such that ⟨Φ(xi), z⟩H ̸= ⟨Φ(xj), z⟩H
whenever i ̸= j. Without loss of generality, we may assume that z is a vector in M.
For any vector y in M, if there existed 1 ≤i(y) < j(y) ≤n such that ⟨Φ(xi(y)), y⟩H =
⟨Φ(xj(y)), y⟩H, then we would have
M ⊂
[
1≤i<j≤n
{Φ(xi) −Φ(xj)}⊥,
where the above orthogonal complements are taken in M. However, comparing the volumes
of M and {Φ(xi) −Φ(xj)}⊥in M, we have a contradiction. Hence, there exists a vector
z in M such that
⟨Φ(xi), z⟩H ̸= ⟨Φ(xj), z⟩H
(i ̸= j).
Moreover, setting ψ(x) = ⟨Φ(x), z⟩H and z = Pn
j=1 cjΦ(xj), we have,
ψ(x) = ⟨z, Φ(x)⟩H =
n
X
j=1
cj⟨Φ(xj), Φ(x)⟩H =
n
X
j=1
cjk(x, xj) =
n
X
j=1
cjkxj(x).
7

Hence, ψ belongs to Htk. Thus, we have the ﬁrst half of the theorem. Moreover, since
∥kx −ky∥2
Hk = k(x, x) −2 Re k(x, y) + k(y, y)
= ⟨Φ(x), Φ(x)⟩H −2 Re⟨Φ(x), Φ(y)⟩H + ⟨Φ(y), Φ(y)⟩H
= ∥Φ(x) −Φ(y)∥2
H,
we have the second half by Lemma 3.4.

Examples
4.1
Gaussian kernel
Let H be any Hilbert space. Then, it is well known that
exp
 −t∥x −y∥2
H

is strictly positive deﬁnite on H × H for any t > 0. Indeed, this is a direct consequence of
Theorem 3.5.
4.2
Drury-Arveson kernel
Let H be a Hilbert space, and let BH be the open unit ball in H. Then, it is well known
that
1
1 −⟨x, y⟩H
is strictly positive deﬁnite on BH × BH (see Subsection 7.3.1 in [7]). Indeed, consider the
case where k(x, y) = ⟨x, y⟩H and ϕ(z) = P∞
n=0 zn in Theorem 3.3 .
4.3
Pseudo-hyperbolic distance
Let D be the open unit disk in the complex plane C. Then, it is well known that D is a
metric space with the distance function
d(λ, µ) =

λ −µ
1 −µλ

(λ, µ ∈D),
which is called the pseudo-hyperbolic distance. We shall prove that
Kt(λ, µ) = exp
 
−t

λ −µ
1 −µλ

2!
is strictly positive deﬁnite on D2 for any t > 0. We set
ψ(λ, µ) = d(λ, µ)2.
8

Then, trivially, ψ is real-valued and symmetric. Let H2 denote the Hardy space over D,
and let sλ be the normalized reproducing kernel of H2, that is, we set
sλ(z) =
p
1 −|λ|2
1 −λz
(λ ∈D).
Then, for any n in N, λ1, . . . , λn in D, and c1, . . . , cn in C such that Pn
j=1 cj = 0, we have
n
X
i,j=1
cicjψ(λi, λj) =

n
X
i,j=1
cicj⟨sλi, sλj⟩H2⟨sλi, sλj⟩H2
≤0
by the Schur product theorem. Hence, ψ is conditionally negative deﬁnite. In particular,
exp(−tψ) is a kernel for any t > 0 by Schoenberg’s generator theorem (Theorem 9.7 in
[7]). Moreover, it follows from Proposition 9.3 in [7] that
k(λ, µ) = −ψ(λ, µ) + ψ(λ, 0) + ψ(0, µ) −ψ(0, 0)
= −d(λ, µ)2 + |λ|2 + |µ|2
(4.1)
is a kernel on D2. Let Hk denote the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by this
k. Then, we have
1
2∥kλ −kµ∥2
Hk = 1
2(k(λ, λ) −2k(λ, µ) + k(µ, µ))
= 1
2{2|λ|2 −2(−d(λ, µ)2 + |λ|2 + |µ|2) + 2|µ|2}
= d(λ, µ)2
= ψ(λ, µ).
Hence, by virtue of Theorem 3.5, in order to prove that Kt is strictly positive deﬁnite, it
suﬃces to show that the map Φ : λ 7→kλ is injective. However, it is trivial, because
d(λ, µ)2 = 1
2∥kλ −kµ∥2
Hk.

4.4
Word metric
Let G be a free group with the ﬁnite generators a1, . . . , aN. For any element g in G, |g|
will denote the word length of g. Then, it is well known that d(g, h) = |h−1g| deﬁnes a
metric on G, which is called the word metric on G. Furthermore, in [2], Haagerup showed
that
Kt(g, h) = exp(−t|h−1g|)
is positive semi-deﬁnite on G × G for any t > 0. We shall show that Kt is strictly positive
deﬁnite. Some notations in Lemma 1.2 of [2] are needed. We set
Λj = {(g, h) ∈G × G : g−1h = aj}
and
Λ =
N
[
j=1
Λj.
Then, HΛ denotes a Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis {e(g,h)}(g,h)∈Λ indexed by Λ.
Moreover, we set e(g,h) = −e(h,g) if g−1h = a−1
j
for some 1 ≤j ≤N. Let g be an element
in G, and let g = g1 · · · gn be the word for g. Then, we set f0 = e, the unit element of G,
and f −1
ℓ−1fℓ= gℓfor 1 ≤ℓ≤n. Let Φ be the map from Λ to HΛ deﬁned as follows:
Φ(g) = e(f0,f1) + e(f1,f2) + · · · + e(fn−1,fn).
Then, it is proved that
∥Φ(g) −Φ(h)∥2
HΛ = |h−1g|
(4.2)
(see p. 283 of [2]). Hence, by virtue of Theorem 3.5, in order to show that Kt is strictly
positive deﬁnite, it suﬃces to show that Φ : G →HΛ is injective. However, it is trivial by
(4.2).

Universality
In this section, we deal with real-valued kernels and real Hilbert spaces. Let X be a locally
compact Hausdorﬀspace, and let k = k(x, y) be a real-valued continuous kernel on X ×X.
Then, exp k is continuous, and so are all functions in exp Hk. Let K be a compact subset
in X, and let C(K) be the Banach algebra consisting of all continuous functions on K.
Then it follows from (2.2) that
∥f∥∞,K := sup
x∈K
|f(x)| ≤∥F∥F sup
x∈K
exp k(x, x)
2
< ∞.
for every f in exp Hk. Let F0 denote the subspace of F consisting of vectors with ﬁnite
support. Then, by Lemma 3.1, ΓF0 is an algebra. In fact, the following diagram commutes:
H⊗n

where Ψ is a function in H⊗m
k
, and we set ψ = Ψ ◦∆m and
LΨ : H⊗n

k
,
F 7→Ψ ⊗F.
Hence, the closure of {f|K : f ∈ΓF0} with respect to the norm ∥· ∥∞,K is a Banach sub-
algebra of C(K). This observation leads us to a new proof of the universal approximation
theorem for the Gaussian kernel. The following is the main theorem of this section. (cf.
Theorem 9 in Steinwart [9] and Theorem 4.1 in Guella [1]).
Theorem 5.1. Let X be a locally compact Hausdorﬀspace, and let k = k(x, y) be a real-
valued continuous kernel on X ×X. If Hk separates any distinct two points in X, then, for
any compact subset K in X, any ε > 0 and any function f in C(K), there exist c1, . . . , cN
in R and a1, . . . , aN in X such that

Proof. Let A denote the Banach algebra obtained by taking the closure of {f|K : f ∈ΓF0}
with respect to the norm ∥· ∥∞,K. Then, it follows from the Stone-Weierstrass theorem
that A = C(K). Hence, for any ε > 0 and any function f in C(K), there exists a vector
G in F0 such that ∥f −ΓG∥∞,K < ε. Moreover, there exists a ﬁnite linear combination h
of reproducing kernels of exp Hk such that ∥ΓG −h∥exp Hk < ε. Hence, setting
MK = sup
x∈K
exp k(x, x)
2
,
MK is ﬁnite and we have
|f(x) −h(x)| ≤|f(x) −(ΓG)(x)| + |(ΓG)(x) −h(x)|
≤∥f −ΓG∥∞,K + ∥ΓG −h∥exp Hk∥exp kx∥exp Hk
< (1 + MK)ε
for any x in K. Therefore, we have the conclusion.
Corollary 5.2. For any compact subset K in Rn, any ε > 0 and any function f in C(K),
there exist c1, . . . , cN in R and a1, . . . , aN in Rn such that

Proof. We set k(x, y) = 2⟨x, y⟩Rn. Then, k is a real-valued continuous kernel on R2. Let f
be any function in C(K). Then, by Theorem 5.1, there exist d1, . . . , dN in R and a1, . . . , aN
in Rn such that
