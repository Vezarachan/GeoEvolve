BOUNDARY BEHAVIOUR OF WEIGHTED BERGMAN KERNELS
AAKANKSHA JAIN AND KAUSHAL VERMA
Abstract. For a planar domain D ⊂C and an admissible weight function µ on it,
some aspects of the boundary behaviour of the corresponding weighted Bergman kernel
KD,µ are studied. First, under the assumption that µ extends continuously to a smooth
boundary point p of D and is non-vanishing there, we obtain a precise relation between
KD,µ and the classical Bergman kernel KD near p. Second, when viewed as functions
of such weights, the weighted Bergman kernel is shown to have a suitable additive and
multiplicative property near such boundary points.
1. Introduction
Let D ⊂Cn be a domain and µ a positive measurable function on it. Let L2
µ(D) denote
the space of all functions on D that are square integrable with respect to µdV , where
dV denotes standard Lebesgue measure, and set Oµ(D) = L2
µ(D) ∩O(D). The class of
weights µ for which Oµ(D) ⊂L2
µ(D) is closed, and for any z ∈D, the point evaluations
z 7→f(z) ∈C are bounded on Oµ(D) were considered by Pasternak–Winiarski in [11], [12]
and termed admissible therein. In this situation, there is a reproducing kernel KD,µ(z, w)
which is the weighted Bergman kernel with weight µ. Let KD,µ(z) = KD,µ(z, z) for z ∈D.
A suﬃcient condition for µ to be admissible is that µ−a be locally integrable in D with
respect to dV for some a > 0 – see [12]. In particular, this holds if 1/µ ∈L∞
loc(D). As
usual, the classical Bergman kernel and its restriction to the diagonal will be denoted by
KD(z, w) and KD(z) respectively, and this corresponds to the case µ ≡1.
The purpose of this note is to quantitatively compare KD,µ(z) with KD(z). Let us
ﬁx the notations ﬁrst. For quantities A, B, the notation A ∼λB will mean that A/B
approaches λ when suitable limits are taken, while A ≈B will mean that A/B is bounded
above and below by positive constants. As is customary, for a domain D ⊂Cn, δ(z)
denotes the Euclidean distance of z to the boundary ∂D. Finally, for a domain D ⊂Cn
and a ﬁxed base point p ∈∂D, let A(D, p) be the collection of all admissible weights
µ ∈C0(D) ∩L∞(D) that extend continuously to p with µ(p) > 0.
Theorem 1.1. Let D ⊂C be a bounded domain and suppose that p ∈∂D is a C2-smooth
boundary point. Let µ ∈A(D, p). Then
KD,µ(z) ∼

Various estimates have been obtained for weighted Bergman kernels in diﬀerent settings
with varying assumptions on the weights. From this extensive basket of results, we men-
tion [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as prototypes that are perhaps closest in spirit to Theorem 1.1 in the
sense that they deal with estimates for these kernels on a given domain with suitable as-
sumptions on the weights such as log–plurisuperharmonicity ([2, 3]) or admitting a power
series representation involving the deﬁning function and its logarithm ([4]). On the other
hand, Theorem 1.1 rests only on the continuity of µ at a boundary point and provides
precise boundary estimates for the weighted kernel; for simply connected domains, it pro-
vides information on all derivatives of the weighted kernel near such a point. The scaling
principle is used to reduce the proof to the paradigm of a Ramadanov type theorem for a
family of varying domains, that are not necessarily monotone and equipped with varying
weights – see [10] for a related Ramadanov theorem of this type. The presence of varying
weights is due to the fact that the weighted kernels transform as
(1.1)
KD1,µ(z, w) = Jf(z)KD2,µ◦f−1(f(z), f(w))Jf(w)
under a biholomorphism f : D1 →D2; here, Jf is the Jacobian determinant of f. Another
ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.1 that we have had to rely on is the Riemann mapping
theorem, and it is for this reason that we do not know whether it holds for domains in
Cn.
The weights we have considered do not vanish on the boundary. At the other extreme,
take D ⊂Cn, a smoothly bounded domain and consider the class of weights given by
µd(z) = K−d
D (z) for some integer d ≥0.
These weights vanish on the boundary ∂D
and are admissible since 1/µd = Kd
D is locally bounded on D. Denote the corresponding
weighted Bergman kernel by KD,d. The intrinsic advantage of µd as a weight is that KD,d
transforms much like the unweighted kernel under biholomorphisms. It can be checked
that
KD1,d(z, w) = (Jf(z))d+1KD2,d(f(z), f(w))(Jf(w))d+1
for a biholomorphism f : D1 →D2 – this holds for domains in Cn also. Adapting the
techniques from [1], shows that
KD,d(z) ∼(2d + 1)(KD(z))d+1
as z →p ∈∂D.
Theorem 1.1 has a useful consequence. It clariﬁes the relation between the Bergman
kernel associated to a sum or product of suitable weights and the sum or product of such
kernels arising from individual weights.
Corollary 1.2. Let D ⊂C and p ∈∂D be as in Theorem 1.1. For 1 ≤i ≤n, let µi be
a ﬁnite collection of weights in A(D, p). Let αi > 0 be a given n-tuple of positive reals.
Then, as z →p,

2. Weights that do not vanish on the boundary
In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. A quick recap of the scaling principle is as follows: let D ⊂C be
a domain and p ∈∂D a C2-smooth boundary point of D. Let ψ be a C2-smooth deﬁning
function for D in a neighbourhood U of p. Choose a sequence pj in D converging to p.
For j ≥1, let
Tj(z) = z −pj
−ψ(pj),
z ∈C
and set Dj = Tj(D). Note that 0 ∈Dj for every j as Tj(pj) = 0. Let K ⊂C be a compact
set. Since ψ(pj) →0 as j →∞, the Tj(U)’s eventually contain every compact set and
hence, K in particular. By writing the Taylor series expansion of ψ near z = pj, we see
that
ψ ◦T −1
j (ζ) = ψ(pj + ζ(−ψ(pj))) = ψ(pj) + 2ℜ
∂ψ
∂z (pj)ζ

(−ψ(pj)) + (ψ(pj))2 O(1)
where O(1) is a term that is uniformly bounded on K as j varies. Therefore, the functions
ψ ◦T −1
j
are well deﬁned on K for all large j.
Now note that the deﬁning functions of Dj near Tj(p) ∈∂Dj are given by
ψj(z) =
1
(−ψ(pj))ψ ◦T −1
j (z) = −1 + 2ℜ
∂ψ
∂z (pj)z

+ (−ψ(pj)) O(1).
We now claim that the ψj’s converge to
ψ∞(z) = −1 + 2ℜ
∂ψ
∂z (p)z

on all compact subsets of C. For simplicity, assume that ∂ψ
∂z (p) = 1 by a suitable nor-
malization. Therefore, ψ∞(z) = −1 + 2ℜz. Let H denote the half space deﬁned by ψ∞,
i.e.,
H = {z : −1 + 2ℜz < 0} .
To see the convergence of ψj’s to ψ∞on compact sets of C, note that ψj is a deﬁning
function of Dj on Tj(U), and Tj(U) eventually contains K ∩Dj for any compact subset
K ⊂C. Hence
K ∩Dj = {z ∈K : ψj(z) < 0}
for suﬃciently large j. Since ψj →ψ∞uniformly on compacts, K ∩Dj converges in the
Hausdorﬀsense to {z ∈K : ψ∞(z) < 0} = K ∩H. Thus, the domains Dj converge to H
in the Hausdorﬀsense on every compact subset of C. The same reasoning shows that the
domains Tj(D ∩U) also converge to the same limiting half-space H in the Hausdorﬀsense
on compact sets. In particular, every compact subset of H is eventually contained in Dj

(as well as Tj(D ∩U)), and every compact subset that is disjoint from H is eventually
disjoint from Dj (as well as Tj(D ∩U)).
Moving ahead, we want to study the behavior of KD(pj, pj) as j →∞. The transfor-
mation formula for the weighted Bergman kernels under biholomorphisms Tj : D →Dj
gives
(2.1)
KD,µ(z, w) = Tj
′(z) KDj,µ◦T −1
j (Tj(z), Tj(w)) Tj
′(w),
z, w ∈D.
Let µj = µ ◦T −1
j . Since T ′
j ≡−1/ψ(pj), we have
(2.2)
KD,µ(z, w) =
1
(ψ(pj))2 KDj,µj(Tj(z), Tj(w)),
z, w ∈D.
Since Tj(pj) = 0 for all j ≥1, we obtain
KD,µ(pj, pj) =
1
(ψ(pj))2 KDj,µj(0, 0).
Therefore, it is enough to study the behavior of KDj,µj(0, 0) as j →∞.
Case 1. Since D is simply connected and Tj’s are aﬃne maps, the domains Dj’s are also
simply connected. Let Fj : Dj →H be the Riemann maps such that Fj(0) = 0 and
Fj
′(0) > 0. Let νj = µj ◦F −1
j
= µ ◦T −1
j
◦F −1
j . The transformation formula for the
weighted Bergman kernels under Fj’s gives
(2.3)
KDj,µj(z, w) = F ′
j(z) KH,µj◦F −1
j (Fj(z), Fj(w)) F ′
j(w),
z, w ∈Dj.
Let νj = µj ◦F −1

= µ ◦T −1

Note that νj(z) = µ

.
By
Proposition 2.1 below, F −1
j (K) is uniformly bounded on compact sets K ⊂C. Since µ
extends continuously to p, it follows that
νj →ν∞≡µ(p) > 0
locally uniformly on H. The problem is therefore reduced to studying the Riemann maps
Fj and the kernels KH,νj. Note that the domain is now ﬁxed (i.e., H) and only the weights
vary.
Proposition 2.1. The Riemann maps Fj converge to the identity map iH locally uniformly
on H.
Proof. Since every compact K ⊂C \ H is eventually contained in C \ Dj, both families
{Fj} and {F −1
j } omit at least two values in C and ﬁx the origin. Therefore, {Fj} and
{F −1
j } are normal families.
Pick a subsequence {jk} such that both {Fjk} and {F −1
jk } converge locally uniformly
on H to some holomorphic functions F, G : H →H respectively and F(0) = G(0) = 0.
Since H is biholomorphic to the unit disc D, we may assume that F, G : D →D and there
is an interior point z0 ∈D that is ﬁxed by both F, G. Now neither F nor G can map an
interior point of D to a point on ∂D, for in this case, either would reduce to a constant
function by a standard argument using peak functions that exist at each point on ∂D.
This would contradict the fact that F, G both ﬁx z0 ∈D. Going back to H, this means
that F, G : H →H.

Now, Fjk ◦F −1
jk ≡idH and F −1
jk ◦Fjk ≡idDj. Since Fjk ◦F −1
jk converges to F ◦G locally
uniformly on H, we have F ◦G ≡idH. Since any compact K ⊂H is eventually contained
in Dj, the sequence F −1
jk ◦Fjk converges to G ◦F uniformly on K. So, (G ◦F)|K ≡idK
and therefore G ◦F ≡idH. Thus, F is an automorphism of H such that F(0) = 0 and
F ′(0) > 0.
Let ϕ : H →D be the Riemann map such that ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ′(0) > 0.
Then,
φ = ϕ ◦F ◦ϕ−1 is an automorphism of D such that φ(0) = 0 and φ′(0) > 0. So, φ ≡idD
and therefore F ≡IdH.
Hence, the Riemann maps Fj converge to the identity map idH locally uniformly on
H.

The following characterization of weighted Bergman kernels from [10] will be used.
Lemma 2.2. Let Ωbe a domain in Cn and ν be an admissible weight on Ω. For w ∈Ω,
let Sν,w(Ω) ⊂Oν(Ω) denote the set of all functions f such that f(w) ≥0 and ∥f∥L2ν(Ω) ≤
p
f(w). Then the weighted Bergman function KΩ,ν(·, w) is uniquely characterized by the
properties:
(i) KΩ,ν(·, w) ∈Sν,w(Ω);
(ii) if f ∈Sν,w(Ω) and f(w) ≥KΩ,ν(w, w), then f(·) ≡KΩ,ν(·, w).
Proposition 2.3. We have that
lim
j→∞KH,νj = KH,ν∞
locally uniformly on H × H.
Proof. Let W ⊂H be a compact. Choose a neighborhood f
W ⊂⊂H of W. Since {F −1
j }
is a normal family on H, there exists a compact set W0 ⊂C such that F −1
j (f
W) ⊂W0
for all j ≥1. Choose a neighborhood V ⊂C of p such that µ ≥c a.e. on D ∩V for
some constant c > 0. Since the domains Tj(V ) eventually contain every compact subset,
W0 ⊂Tj(V ) for all large j. Thus, νj ≥c a.e. on f
W for all large j.
For a domain Ω⊂C, an admissible weight ρ on Ωand z ∈Ω, it is straightforward to
check that (proof is similar to the classical case; see [7])
(2.4)
KΩ,ρ(z, z)−1/2 = min{∥g∥L2ρ(Ω) : g ∈Oρ(Ω), g(z) = 1},
where we assume that KΩ,ρ(z, z) > 0. Therefore, if ˜Ω⊂Ωis a domain with an admissible
weight ˜ρ on ˜Ωsuch that ˜ρ ≤ρ a.e. on ˜Ω, then K˜Ω,˜ρ(z, z) ≥KΩ,ρ(z, z) for every z ∈˜Ω.
This is the monotonicity property. It holds even when KΩ,ρ(z, z) = 0 because K˜Ω,˜ρ(z, z)
is always non-negative.
Since D is bounded and µ ∈L∞(D), the constant function 1 belongs to Oµ(D). This
implies that KD,µ(z, z) > 0 for every z ∈D. Now (2.1) and (2.3) show that KH,νj(z, z) > 0
for all z ∈H and j ≥1.

is a normal family. It suﬃces to show that
every subsequence converges to the kernel KH,ν∞. By taking a subsequence and retaining
notion, assume that

ﬁrst variable and anti-holomorphic in the second.

Therefore, k(·, w) ∈Oν∞(H). Also, k(w, w) ≥0 and ∥k(·, w)∥L2ν∞(H) ≤

k(w, w). Thus,
the function k(·, w) ∈Sν∞,w(H). Since µ ∈L∞(D), there exists a constant M > 0 such
that νj ≤M for all j and hence

for all j. This shows that KH,ν∞(·, w)/KH,ν∞(w, w) ∈Oνj(H) for every j. Furthermore,
note that KH,νj(·, w)/KH,νj(w, w) is the unique solution of the extremal problem
min{∥f∥L2νj (H) : f ∈Oνj(H), f(w) = 1},

i.e., k(w, w) ≥KH,ν∞(w, w).
Therefore, k(·, w) ≡KH,ν∞(·, w) by Lemma 2.2.
Since
w ∈H was arbitrary, k = KH,ν∞.

Hence, (2.3), Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.3 show that
lim
j→∞KDj,µj = KH,ν∞
locally uniformly on H × H.
The same holds for all the derivatives of the weighted
Bergman kernel, where derivative estimates follow from the Cauchy integral formula.
For integers α, β ≥0, let us denote

Kα,β

Applying the transformation formula for the Bergman

gives that for z, w ∈H (see [7])

□
Case 2. When D is not simply connected, KD,µ(z) can be localized near p as in Proposition
2.4 below.
This is possible because p, being a C2-smooth boundary point, is a local
holomorphic peak point (see [7] for details).

Proposition 2.4. [Localization] Let D ⊂C be a bounded domain and suppose that p ∈∂D
is a local holomorphic peak point. Let µ ∈A(D, p). Then there exists a neighbourhood U
of p such that
lim
ζ→p
KD,µ(ζ, ζ)
KD∩U,µ(ζ, ζ) = 1
where KD∩U,µ denotes the Bergman kernel for D ∩U with respect to the weight µ|D∩U.
Proof. The standard proof using L2-methods works verbatim for the weighted case because
of the lower and upper bounds on the weight µ as µ ∈A(D, p). The assumptions on µ
imply that KD∩U,µ is well-deﬁned and positive. Further, since L2(D) ⊂L2
µ(D), several
auxiliary functions that appear in the standard proof and belong to pertinent L2-spaces
are actually in L2
µ(D). The details are omitted. See [7] for details.
□
Choose a neighborhood U of p in C as in Proposition 2.4 such that D ∩U is simply
connected. Note that µ|D∩U ∈A(D ∩U, p). For a sequence pj in D ∩U converging to the
boundary point p, it therefore follows from Case 1 that
lim
j→∞
KD∩U,µ(pj, pj)
KD∩U(pj, pj) =
1
µ(p).
Hence, by Proposition 2.4 we have

Hence,

as z →p.
□
This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.
□
Remark 2.5. From the proof of Theorem 1.1, observe that the boundedness assumption
on D is used only in the localization. A diﬀerent technique for localization from [9] can
be adapted here to localize the weighted Bergman kernels for unbounded domains. The
details are omitted.

3. Concluding Remarks and Questions
Theorem 1.1 shows that the weighted kernel KD,µ and the classical one KD have the
same rate of blow up near a smooth boundary point. However, D is assumed to be simply
connected in order to get estimates on the boundary behaviour of the derivatives of KD,µ.
We believe that the simply connected assumption can be dispensed with but we have
not been able to show this. Further, it is also not clear whether these estimates hold for
domains in Cn even with additional pseudoconvexity assumptions. In the same vein, the
assumption that µ(p) > 0 is crucially used. This raises the question of what happens if
µ(p) = 0. The weights of the form µd = K−d
D , d ≥0, all vanish on the boundary. For
this speciﬁc class of weights, the boundary behaviour is known as indicated. But can
something be said for the weighted kernels arising from general weights that vanish on
the boundary?
The connection between the weighted Bergman kernel and Green’s function has been
recently explored in [8]. It would be interesting to see how the weighted Green’s function
ﬁts within the paradigm studied here.

A STUDY ON HOLOMORPHIC ISOMETRIES OF WEIGHTED
BERGMAN METRICS
AAKANKSHA JAIN AND KAUSHAL VERMA
Abstract. For a domain D ⊂Cn and an admissible weight µ on it, we consider the
weighted Bergman kernel KD,µ and the corresponding weighted Bergman metric on
D. In particular, motivated by work of Mok, Ng, Chan–Yuan and Chan–Xiao–Yuan
among others, we study the nature of holomorphic isometries from the disc D ⊂C with
respect to the weighted Bergman metrics arising from weights of the form µ = K−d
D
for
some integer d ≥0. These metrics provide a natural class of examples that give rise
to positive conformal constants that have been considered in various recent works on
isometries. Speciﬁc examples of isometries that are studied in detail include those in
which the isometry takes values in Dn and D × Bn where each factor admits a weighted
Bergman metric as above for possibly diﬀerent non-negative integers d. Finally, the case
of isometries between polydisks in possibly diﬀerent dimensions, in which each factor has
a diﬀerent weighted Bergman metric as above, is also presented.
1. Introduction
Let D ⊂Cn be a domain and µ a positive measurable function on it. Let L2
µ(D) denote
the space of all functions on D that are square integrable with respect to µdV , where
dV denotes standard Lebesgue measure, and set Oµ(D) = L2
µ(D) ∩O(D). The class of
weights µ for which Oµ(D) ⊂L2
µ(D) is closed, and for any z ∈D, the point evaluations
z 7→f(z) ∈C are bounded on Oµ(D) were considered by Pasternak–Winiarski in [9], [10]
and termed admissible therein. In this situation, there is a reproducing kernel KD,µ(z, w)
which is the weighted Bergman kernel with weight µ. Let KD,µ(z) = KD,µ(z, z) for z ∈D.
A suﬃcient condition for µ to be admissible is that µ−a be locally integrable in D with
respect to dV for some a > 0 (see [10]). In particular, this holds if 1/µ ∈L∞
loc(D).
Within our framework, we shall consider weights that extend continuously to D and
are not necessarily positive on ∂D. This condition is not a restrictive one and will be seen
to arise naturally in what follows.
As usual, the classical Bergman kernel and its restriction to the diagonal will be denoted
by KD(z, w) and KD(z) respectively, and this corresponds to the case µ ≡1.
The purpose of this note is to study holomorphic maps from the disc D ⊂C that are
isometries with respect to metrics arising from weighted Bergman kernels. Two classes of
weights will be considered here - one, those that are non-vanishing on the boundary and
two, a speciﬁc class of examples of weights that do vanish on the boundary.

Let D ⊂Cn be a bounded domain and µ a positive continuous weight on D. Then
L2(D) = L2
µ(D) and therefore, KD,µ, which can be written as
KD,µ(z) = sup{|f(z)|2 : f ∈Oµ(D), ∥f∥µ = 1}
is a positive plurisubharmonic function on D. The weighted Bergman metric
ds2
D,µ =
X
i,j
∂2
∂zi∂zj
log KD,µ(z) dzi ⊗dzj
is, therefore, well-deﬁned on D. When µ ≡1, ds2
D will denote the classical (= unweighted)
Bergman metric on D.
Theorem 1.1. Let D1 ⊂Cn, D2 ⊂Cm be bounded domains and suppose that µ1, µ2 are
positive continuous weights on D1, D2 respectively. Let f : (D1, ds2
D1,µ1) →(D2, ds2
D2,µ2)
be a holomorphic isometry. Then, there exist functions s0 ∈Oµ1(D1) and r0 ∈Oµ2(D2)
such that
s0(z) s0(w) KD2,µ2(f(z), f(w)) = r0(f(z)) r0(f(w)) KD1,µ1(z, w)
for all z, w ∈D1. In particular, if D1 = D2 = D and µ1 ≡1, then f is an automorphism
of D.
Some comments are in order. Theorem 1.1 and its proof are directly motivated by
Mok’s work (see [5]) on the extension of germs of local isometries of the Bergman metric.
The functional relation between the weighted Bergman kernels does not require f to be
deﬁned on all of D1. In fact, ﬁx base points a, b in D1, D2 respectively and suppose that f
is a germ of a holomorphic isometry deﬁned near a such that f(a) = b. The proof shows
that the same functional equation holds for z, w near a. However, given such a germ of
a holomorphic isometry, we do not know whether this germ extends to all of D1 in the
spirit of [5].
For a biholomorphism f : D1 →D2 and an admissible weight µ on D1, the weight
µ ◦f −1 on D2 is also admissible.
Therefore, KD2,µ◦f−1 is well-deﬁned.
The weighted
kernels transform as
(1.1)
KD1,µ(z, w) = Jf(z)KD2,µ◦f−1(f(z), f(w))Jf(w).
Here, Jf is the Jacobian determinant of f. Hence, f is an isometry with respect to the
metrics corresponding to these weighted kernels.
Theorem 1.1 talks about isometries,
where the weights need not vary with the holomorphic function.
Moving ahead, we now consider a smoothly bounded planar domain D ⊂C and weights
of the form µd(z) = K−d
D (z) for some integer d ≥0. The Bergman kernel on the diagonal
for such domains blows up at the boundary and hence the weights µd can be regarded
to extend continuously to the boundary ∂D by setting µd ≡0 on ∂D. Further, they
are admissible since 1/µd = Kd
D is locally bounded on D. The corresponding weighted
Bergman kernel will be denoted by KD,d. The intrinsic advantage of working with µd as a
weight is that KD,d transforms much like the unweighted kernel under biholomorphisms.
It can be checked that
(1.2)
KD1,d(z, w) = (Jf(z))d+1KD2,d(f(z), f(w))(Jf(w))d+1
for a biholomorphism f : D1 →D2 – this holds for domains in Cn also. Since µd = 0
on ∂D, L2(D) ⊂L2
µd(D) which implies that KD,d(z) > 0 everywhere and hence the

corresponding metric ds2
D,d is well-deﬁned on D. The transformation rule (1.2) shows
that biholomorphisms are isometries of the weighted metrics ds2
D,d. As before, one could
ask for an understanding of the isometries with respect to these weighted metrics. We,
therefore, turn to the question of studying isometries of the metrics ds2
D,d. We will focus
on the case when D = D and write ds2
d, instead of ds2
D,d, for brevity. The conclusions are
computationally complete here and moreover, they can be regarded as weighted analogs
of the work of S-C Ng [8] and others. The point here is ds2
D,d provides a natural class of
metrics that give rise to positive conformal constants that have been considered in various
other works on isometries.
Theorem 1.2. Let d, d1, d2, . . . , dn be non-negative integers and suppose that
f : (D, ds2
d) →(D, ds2
d1) × (D, ds2
d2) × · · · × (D, ds2
dn)
is a holomorphic isometry such that all the component functions of f are non-constant.
Then,
d + 1 ≤
n
X
i=1
(di + 1).
In case equality holds, there are unimodular constants α1, α2, . . . , αn such that
f(z) = (α1z, α2z, . . . , αnz)
after a possible reparametrization. Moreover, for every 1 ≤i ≤n, there exist integers
1 ≤i = k1, k2, . . . , kji ≤n such that
ji
X
r=1
(dkr + 1) = d + 1.
In particular, di ≤d for each 1 ≤i ≤n.
A complete classiﬁcation of holomorphic isometries from the disc into the bidisc can
be found in [8] and its generalization to the case with positive conformal constants in [2].
The case of holomorphic isometries into the tridisc has been explored in [3, 8]. The next
theorem clariﬁes the situation of isometries into the polydisc in C3 by giving the complete
characterization.
Theorem 1.3. Let n = 3 in Theorem 1.2, that is, let
f : (D, ds2
d) →(D, ds2
d1) × (D, ds2
d2) × (D, ds2
d3)
be a holomorphic isometry such that all the component functions of f are non-constant.
A complete characterization of all possible isometries f is as follows:
(a) d1 = d2 = d3 = d. In this case, up to a reparametrization, f is either the cube root
embedding or f can be factorized as
f(z) = (α1(z), α2(β1(z)), β2(β1(z)))
where z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) is a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 for
both i = 1, 2.

(c) dk1 = d and P
i=2,3
(dki + 1) = d + 1, where ki ̸= kj, i ̸= j and ki ∈{1, 2, 3}. In this
case, up to a reparametrization,
f(z) = (c α(z), α(z), β(z))
where c ∈C is a unimodular constant and z 7→(α(z), β(z)) is a holomorphic
isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2

(dki + 1) = d + 1 = P

this case, up to a reparametrization,
f(z) = (z, α(z), β(z))
where z 7→(α(z), β(z)) is a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2.
The concluding statements below are motivated by Chan–Yuan [3] and Ng [8] respec-
tively.
Theorem 1.4. Let d, d1, d2 be non-negative integers and
f : (D, ds2
d) →(D, ds2
d1) × (Bn, ds2
d2)
be a holomorphic isometry. Then,
2(d + 1) ≤2(d1 + 1) + (n + 1)(d2 + 1)
and equality holds precisely when, up to reparametrization, f(z) = (cz, c1z, . . . , cnz) where
|c| = 1 and the vector (c1, c2, . . . , cn) ∈∂Bn.
Theorem 1.5. Let c1, c2, . . . , cm and d1, d2, . . . , dn be non-negative integers and
f : (D, ds2
c1) × · · · × (D, ds2
cm) →(D, ds2
d1) × · · · × (D, ds2
dn)
be a holomorphic isometry. Let f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn). Then, after a possible reparametriza-
tion, there exist positive integers n1, n2, . . . , nm with n1 + n2 + . . . + nm = n such that
f1, . . . , fn1 depend on z1 only, fn1+1, . . . , fn1+n2 depend on z2 only, and so on till the ﬁnal
subset of components fn1+n2+...+nm−1+1, . . . , fn depend on zm only.
In particular, the i-th group of the above m groups of component functions consti-
tutes a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
ci) into the product (D, ds2
dn1+...+ni−1+1) × · · · ×
(D, ds2
dn1+...+ni); here n0 = 0.
Finally,
ci + 1 ≤
n1+...+ni

and equality holds precisely when fk = akzi for all n1 + . . . + ni−1 + 1 ≤k ≤n1 + . . . + ni,
where all the ak’s are unimodular constants.

2. Weights that do not vanish on the boundary
In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.1 using ideas from [5].
Proof of Theorem 1.1. For a bounded domain D ⊂Cn and a positive continuous weight
µ on D, denote the length of a tangent vector X = (X1, . . . , Xn) at a point z ∈Ωwith
respect to the metric ds2
D,µ by ∥X∥z,D,µ. Then,
∥X∥2
z,D,µ =
X
i,j
∂2
∂zi∂zj
log KD,µ(z)XiXj.
Since f is an isometry,
∥X∥z,D1,µ1 = ∥df(z)X∥f(z),D2,µ2
for z ∈D1 and X ∈Cn, and this implies that
∂∂log KD2,µ2(f(z)) = ∂∂log KD1,µ1(z)
for all z ∈D1. Thus, log KD2,µ2(f(z)) −log KD1,µ1(z) is pluriharmonic and hence can be
locally written as the real part of a holomorphic function.
Case 1. Assume that 0 ∈D1, D2 and f(0) = 0. There exists a holomorphic function ψ
near the origin such that
(2.1)
log KD2,µ2(f(z)) = log KD1,µ1(z) + ℜψ(z),
for z near 0. The hypotheses on the weights imply that for i = 1, 2, L2
µi(Di) = L2(Di) and
that Oµi(Di) contain the constants. By considering the bounded functional g 7→g −g(0)
on Oµi(Di), it is possible to choose orthonormal bases {si}∞
i=0 and {ri}∞
i=0 of Oµ1(D1) and
Oµ2(D2) respectively so that si(0) = ri(0) = 0 for all i ≥1, and s0(0) ̸= 0 ̸= r0(0). For z
near 0,
KD1,µ1(z) =

and by repeating these steps for KD2,µ2,
KD1,µ1(z) = |s0(z)|2 ˜KD1,µ1(z)
and
KD2,µ2(z) = |r0(z)|2 ˜KD2,µ2(z),

for z near the origin. Note that P∞
i=1 |si/s0|2 < 1 in a neighborhood of 0. By working with
the Taylor expansion of log(1 + x), log ˜KD1,µ1(z) can be expressed as a convergent sum
of a countable number of functions of the form ± |θk|2, where each θk is a holomorphic
function vanishing at 0. Therefore, by expanding the θk’s further as a convergent power
series, it follows that the Taylor expansion of log ˜KD1,µ1(z) at 0 does not contain terms
of pure type zI and zI. Here zI = zi1
1 . . . zin
n for z = (z1, . . . , zn) and I = (i1, . . . , in).
Similarly, since f(0) = 0, the same holds for the Taylor expansion of log ˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) at
the origin.
Now (2.1) can be rewritten as
log |r0(f(z))|2 + log ˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) = log |s0(z)|2 + log ˜KD1,µ1(z) + ℜψ(z).

6
AAKANKSHA JAIN AND KAUSHAL VERMA
Since f(0) = 0 and neither of r0, s0 vanish at the origin, both log |r0(f(z))|2 and log |s0(z)|2
are pluriharmonic near the origin in D1. Thus,
∂∂log ˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) = ∂∂log ˜KD1,µ1(z)
and hence, there exists a holomorphic function ˜ψ near the origin such that
(2.2)
log ˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) = log ˜KD1,µ1(z) + ℜ˜ψ(z).
Since the Taylor expansion of ℜ( ˜ψ) = ˜ψ + ˜ψ at the origin consists precisely of terms of
pure type, it follows by comparing the two sides of (2.2) that ℜ˜ψ is a constant. Hence,
˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) = a ˜KD1,µ1(z)
for some constant a > 0. This leads to
KD2,µ2(f(z)) = |r0(f(z))|2 ˜KD2,µ2(f(z)) = a |r0(f(z))|2 ˜KD1,µ1(z) = a |r0(f(z))|2
|s0(z)|2
KD1,µ1(z).
Since KD1,µ1(0) = |s0(0)|2 and KD2,µ2(0) = |r0(0)|2, we observe that
a = KD2,µ2(0) |s0(0)|2
KD1,µ1(0) |r0(0)|2 = 1
by putting z = 0. Thus, for z near 0,
(2.3)
|s0(z)|2 KD2,µ2(f(z)) = |r0(f(z))|2 KD1,µ1(z).
Now polarize this equality. For z, w near the origin, write
s0(z) s0(w) KD2,µ2(f(z), f(w)) = r0(f(z)) r0(f(w)) KD1,µ1(z, w) + H(z, w),
where H(z, w) = P
(I,J) hIJzI ¯wJ is holomorphic in z and anti-holomorphic in w. On
restriction to the diagonal {z = w}, we have H(z, z) = 0, i.e., P hIJzI ¯zJ = 0.
So,
hIJ = 0 for all I, J, and hence H ≡0. Thus,
(2.4)
s0(z) s0(w) KD2,µ2(f(z), f(w)) = r0(f(z)) r0(f(w)) KD1,µ1(z, w).
for z, w near the origin and therefore for all z, w ∈D1.
□
Case 2. Otherwise, choose p ∈D1 and let q = f(p) ∈D2. The translations Λ1 : z 7→z −p
and Λ2 : z 7→z −q move the base points p, q to the origin that are contained in the
bounded images ˆDi = Λi(Di) for i = 1, 2. The weights ˆµi = µi ◦Λ−1
i
are positive and
continuous on the closure of ˆDi for i = 1, 2.
It follows from (1.1) that Λ−1
1
: ( ˆD1, ds2
ˆD1,ˆµ1) →(D1, ds2
D1,µ1) and Λ2 : (D2, ds2
D2,µ2) →
( ˆD2, ds2
ˆD2,ˆµ2) are isometries and therefore, g = Λ2 ◦f ◦Λ−1
1
: ( ˆD1, ds2
ˆD1,ˆµ1) →( ˆD2, ds2
ˆD2,ˆµ2)
is a holomorphic isometry such that g(0) = 0. As before, choose orthonormal bases {si}∞
i=0
and {ri}∞
i=0 of Oµ1(D1) and Oµ2(D2) respectively so that si(p) = 0, ri(q) = 0 for i ≥1,
and s0(p) ̸= 0, r0(q) ̸= 0. Observe that the pull-backs ˆsi = si ◦Λ−1
1
and ˆri = ri ◦Λ−1
2 ,
i ≥0, are orthogonal, i.e., ⟨ˆsi, ˆsj⟩Oˆµ1( ˆD1) = ⟨ˆri, ˆrj⟩Oˆµ2( ˆD2) = δij for all i, j ≥0. Therefore,
{ˆsi}∞
i=0 and {ˆri}∞
i=0 form orthonormal bases of Oˆµ1( ˆD1) and Oˆµ2( ˆD2) respectively, such
that ˆsi(0) = ˆri(0) = 0 for i ≥1 and ˆs0(0) ̸= 0 ̸= ˆr0(0).
It now follows from Case 1 that
ˆs0(z) ˆs0(w) K ˆD2,ˆµ2(g(z), g(w)) = ˆr0(g(z)) ˆr0(g(w)) K ˆD1,ˆµ1(z, w)

for z, w ∈ˆD1. Finally, using the transformation formula KDi,µi(z, w) = K ˆDi,ˆµi(Λi(z), Λi(w))
for i = 1, 2, we obtain
s0(z) s0(w) KD2,µ2(f(z), f(w))
=
s0(z) s0(w) K ˆD2,ˆµ2(Λ2(f(z)), Λ2(f(w)))
=
ˆs0(Λ1(z)) ˆs0(Λ1(w)) K ˆD2,ˆµ2(g(Λ1(z)), g(Λ1(w)))
=
ˆr0(g(Λ1(z))) ˆr0(g(Λ1(w))) K ˆD1,ˆµ1(Λ1(z), Λ1(w))
=
r0(f(z)) r0(f(w)) KD1,µ1(z, w).
for every z, w ∈D1.
□
Finally, if D1 = D2 = D and µ1 ≡1 we can choose p = 0. In this case, s0 ≡1/√π and
r0 is chosen so that r0(f(0)) ̸= 0. Therefore,
KD2,µ2(f(z)) = π |r0(f(z))|2 KD(z),
z ∈D.
Let Z = {r0 = 0} which, if non-empty, is discrete in D. Let zn →∂D. Then f(zn)
cannot cluster at a point in D \ Z, for if it did, then r0(f(zn)) would be non-vanishing
and KD(zn) →∞and this would imply that KD2,µ2(f(zn)) →∞– this is a contradiction
since KD2,µ2(f(zn)) must remain bounded as f(zn) is assumed to cluster at a point in
D \ Z ⊂D. Thus, f : D →D \ Z is proper. Now, by the continuity of f, the cluster
set of ∂D under f is connected. This means that the cluster set cannot intersect Z, for
if it did, then the cluster set would reduce to a point (in Z) and hence f would be a
constant. Contradiction. Therefore, the cluster set of ∂D under f is contained entirely
in ∂D which implies that f is a proper self-map of D. Since f is an isometry, f ′ cannot
vanish. Therefore, f is a covering and hence an automorphism of D. That is, f = eiθϕζ

Remark 2.1. First, the assumption that µ1, µ2 be positive continuous weights is not really
necessary as the proof shows. What is essential is that the spaces Oµi(Di) contain the
constants and be large enough for the metrics ds2
Di,µi to be deﬁned.
Second, in the last part of the proof, assume that D1 = D, µ1 ≡1 and that D2 ⊂Cn
is a bounded domain. The given reasoning shows that the isometry f must be a proper
holomorphic map from D onto D2 \ Z, where Z = {r0 = 0} ⊂D2. In case, D2 ⊂C, then
f : D →D2 must be an unbranched proper mapping.

As a warm-up, we begin with an observation.
Proposition 3.1. For non-negative integers d1 ̸= d2, there cannot exist a holomorphic
isometry
f : (D, ds2
d1) →(D, ds2
d2).
Proof. Let f : (D, ds2
d1) →(D, ds2
d2) be a holomorphic isometry. Here, d1, d2 are non-
negative integers. If f(0) = a, then choose an automorphism φa of D such that φa(a) = 0.
Since the composition of two isometries remains an isometry, φa◦f : (D, ds2
d1) →(D, ds2
d2)
is a holomorphic isometry that ﬁxes the origin. Therefore, without loss of generality, we
can assume that f(0) = 0. Since f is an isometry,
∂2
∂z∂¯z log KD,d2(f(z)) =

which simpliﬁes to

Thus, f ′(0) ̸= 0.
On comparing the coeﬃcients of z, it follows that f ′′(0) = 0 and
therefore,
−2(2d2 + 2) |f ′(0)|2 = −2(2d1 + 2) |f ′(0)|2
on comparing the coeﬃcients of |z|2. This implies that d1 = d2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. For brevity, we will write Kd, Kdi, instead of KD,d, KD,di.
By
composing each component of f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) with a suitable automorphism of D,
we may assume that f(0) = 0 while retaining the fact that the reparametrized f is an

Moving towards the other part of this theorem, we ﬁrst make some preparations, in-
spired by Ng’s work [8].
Proposition 3.2. There exists an irreducible one-dimensional projective analytic subva-
riety V in P1×(P1)n extending the graph of f such that π : V →P1, the natural projection
to the ﬁrst factor, is a ﬁnite branched covering.

In this case, we will add a term Bm1 = 0 on the right-hand side to ensure that

The ﬁrst n equations are of the form
fi = Qi(z, f1, . . . , fn),
i = 1, . . . , n,
where Qi’s are polynomials that do not contain linear terms in the fi’s. These n equations
deﬁne a projective subvariety W ⊂P1 × (P1)n containing the (1-dimensional) graph of
f. Deﬁne the smooth map H : Cn+1 →Cn by Hi(z, f1, . . . , fn) = fi −Qi(z, f1, . . . , fn).
Since f vanishes at 0, the point ¯0 ∈P1 × (P1)n lies on W. Thus, H(0) = 0 and

By the implicit function theorem, there exists a unique holomorphic function g : U →Cn
on some neighborhood U of 0 such that H(z, g(z)) = 0 for all z ∈U. Therefore, W is
smooth at ¯0 and is one-dimensional near ¯0.
Let V be the irreducible component of W containing 0. Note that V contains the graph
of f. The projection π : V →P1 to the ﬁrst factor is a proper map and hence π(V ) is
an analytic subvariety of P1. Since V contains the graph of f, π(V ) cannot be discrete.
Therefore, π(V ) = P1. Also, since V is connected, there exists a positive integer s such
that for a generic point z ∈P1, #(π−1(z)) = s.
□
Consider the projections Pi : V →P1 × P1 deﬁned by Pi(z, ζ1, . . . , ζn) = (z, ζi). Note
that all the Pi’s are proper.
Therefore, Vi = Pi(V ) ⊂P1 × P1 is a one-dimensional
projective subvariety containing the graph of the component function fi : (D, ds2
d) →
(D, ds2
di). Let πi : Vi →P1 denote the proper projection map onto the ﬁrst factor which
exhibits Vi as a ﬁnite branched cover over P1. Let si be the cardinality of π−1
i (z) for a
generic z ∈P1. Since π = πi ◦Pi, it follows that for each i, si divides s.

Lemmas 4.3, 4.4 and Proposition 4.5 from [8] can now be applied verbatim to conclude
the following. First, if (z, a1, . . . , an), (w, b1, . . . , bn) be any two points on V , then
(3.5)

 1 −ai ¯bi
di+1 = (1 −z ¯w)d+1.
Second, let (z, a1, . . . , an) be a point on V . If z ∈C then ai ∈C for all i. Finally, ﬁx an
i ≤n. Then Vi ⊂P1 × P1 is deﬁned by
(3.6)
hsi + Psi−1(z)hsi−1 + Psi−2(z)hsi−2 + · · · + P1(z)h + P0(z) = 0,
where for all j, Pj(z) = ajz + bj for some aj, bj ∈C and b0 = 0.
In fact, (3.6) is
invariant under the assignment (z, h) 7→(1/z, 1/h) and this implies that for |z| = 1, if
hj, 1 ≤j ≤si, are the si roots of (3.6), then 1/hj, 1 ≤j ≤si, is a permutation of the
roots. As a corollary, by replacing the pair (z, h) by (1/z, 1/h), clearing denominators
and taking conjugates in (3.6), we get
z = −h
asi−1 + asi−2h + . . . + a0hsi−1

and this implies that for h = fi(z), z = Ri(fi(z)), where Ri is the rational function of
degree si as given above.
Using Calabi’s theorem, it can be shown that every germ
g : (D, ds2
d; x0) →(D, ds2
d1; y01) × · · · × (D, ds2
dn; y0n)
of a holomorphic isometry can be extended over the whole unit disc (ref. Appendix). Let
A ⊂P1 be a discrete set such that π, when restricted to V \ π−1(A), is a holomorphic
covering. For (z0, a1, . . . , an) ∈V \ π−1(A) with |z0| ̸= 1, there exists a germ of the graph
of a holomorphic function at z0 that takes value (a1, . . . , an) at z0 and lies in V . Since
P1 \ D is biholomorphic to the unit disc, it can be shown that every such germ must
extend to the whole of D or P1 \ D depending upon whether z0 ∈D or z0 ∈P1 \ D.
All these observations have been made in [8], but since we are dealing with the weighted
case, Section 7 contains a brief summary of the minor modiﬁcations need to be made.
Therefore, the branch points of f lie on the unit circle. Since every branch point of fi
must be a branch point of π : V →P1, the branch points of fi must lie on the unit circle.
Recall that each si is a factor of s. Within s branches of f, each coordinate function fi
has si distinct branches and each distinct branch repeats itself s/si times. Further, each
fi takes inﬁnite value at ∞on at least one branch among si branches. Since z = ∞is not
a branch point, there is exactly one branch among the si branches such that fi(∞) = ∞.
Thus, each fi takes an inﬁnite value s/si times at ∞within s branches of f. Recall the
functional equation

Therefore, on each branch of f, at least one component function takes an inﬁnite value

should equal 2d + 2. Since each fi must take an inﬁnite value at z = ∞on at least one of

4. Proof of Theorem 1.3
Recall Mok’s n-th root embedding from [5] – let H denote the upper half-plane equipped
with the hyperbolic metric ds2
H. For n ≥2, deﬁne g : (H, ds2
H) →(H, ds2
H)×· · ·×(H, ds2
H)
by
g(z) = (z1/n, γz1/n, · · · , γn−1z1/n),
where γ = eiπ/n, and if z = reiθ with r > 0 and 0 < θ < π then z1/n = r1/neiθ/n. Then, g
is a holomorphic isometric embedding which is called the n-th root embedding.
A complete characterization of all holomorphic isometries from (D, ds2
d) to (D, ds2
d1) ×
(D, ds2
d2) for non-negative integers d, d1 and d2 was obtained by Chan, Xiao and Yuan in
[2]. Motivated from it, we are interested in examining isometries from D into D × D × D.
Let f = (f1, f2, f3) : (D, ds2
d) →(D, ds2
d1)×(D, ds2
d2)×(D, ds2
d3) be a holomorphic isometry,
where d, d1, d2 and d3 are non-negative integers. If any of the component functions of f
is constant, then our isometry reduces to either an isometry between a pair of discs or an
isometry from a disc to a bidisc. Both cases are known. Therefore, assume that all the
component functions of f are non-constant.
Proposition 4.1. f extends continuously from D to D
3.
Proof. It is enough to show that each fi extends continuously from D to D. Fix i ∈
{1, 2, 3}. For z0 ∈∂D, let π−1
i (z0) = {(z0, a1), . . . , (z0, ar)} where r ≤si. Deﬁne Si to
be the set of all the limit points of sequences {fi(zk)} where zk →z0 as k →∞. Then,
Si ⊂{a1, . . . , ar}. But Si, being the cluster set of z0 under fi, must be connected and
hence must be a point. Therefore, fi extends continuously from D to D.
□
For i = 1, 2, 3, deﬁne
Ai = {b ∈∂D : b is not a branch point of f and |fi(z)| →1 as z →b}.
Lemma 4.2. Fix i ∈{1, 2, 3}. Assume that b ∈∂D is not a branch point of f and
|fi(z)| →1 as z →b. There exists a neighborhood Ub ⊂C of b such that every b′ ∈Ub∩∂D
is not a branch point of f, |fi(z)| →1 as z →b′ and the vanishing order of 1 −fi(z)fi(b′)
at z = b′ equals to one. In particular, Ai is open.
Proof. We can assume, without loss of generality, that f(0) = 0, as the statement remains
true after a reparametrization.
Since every branch point of fi is a branch point of f, b is not a branch point of fi. Let,
π−1
i (b) = {(b, a1), . . . , (b, asi)}. Recall that πi|π−1
i
(P1\A) is a holomorphic covering map.
Therefore, there exists injective holomorphic function hj, 1 ≤j ≤si on a neighborhood
W ⊂C of b such that hj(b) = aj and (z, hj(z)) ∈Vi for all z ∈W and 1 ≤j ≤si. Choose
W (shrink, if necessary) so that the closures of Wj = hj(W) are mutually disjoint, and

1/¯z ∈W whenever z ∈W. There exists 1 ≤ji ≤si such that hji ≡fi on W ∩D. Without
loss of generality, let ji = 1.
Put D+ = D and D−= P1 \ D. Recall that (1/¯z, 1/¯h) ∈Vi whenever (z, h) ∈Vi.
Therefore, U+ = h1(W ∩D+) and U−= h1(W ∩D−) are open and disjoint sets lying
in D+ and D−respectively. Since |h1(b)| = 1, it follows from Open mapping theorem
that h1(W) consists of an open arc γ of ∂D with h1(b) ∈γ. Now h1 is invertible, and
the functional equation gives h−1
1 (γ) ⊂∂D. Hence, there exists an open neighborhood
Ub ⊂C of b such that |fi(z)| →1 as z →b′ for any b′ ∈Ub ∩∂D.
Further, shrink Ub, if necessary, so that every b′ ∈Ub ∩∂D is not a branch point of f
and f ′
i(b′) ̸= 0. The latter ensures that the vanishing order of 1 −fi(z)fi(b′) at z = b′
equals to one.
□
We can assume, without loss of generality, that f(0) = 0, as we shall characterize f up
to reparametrization.
Since f(0) = 0, we have the functional equation
3
Y
i=1
(1 −|fi(z)|2)di+1 = (1 −|z|2)d+1.
Therefore, there must exist some i such that |fi(z)| →1 as |z| →1. Since there exist only
ﬁnitely many branch points of f on ∂D, at least one Ai must be non-empty. The proof
now divides into the following cases.
Case 1. A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ̸= ∅.
That is, there is a point b ∈∂D which is not a branch point of f and |fi(z)| →1 as
z →b for all i = 1, 2, 3. Since f(0) = 0, we have

Note that the vanishing order of 1 −fi(z)fi(b) at z = b equals to one for all i = 1, 2, 3.
On comparing the vanishing order at b in the equation, we obtain P3
i=1(di + 1) = d + 1.
Therefore, by Theorem 1.2, there exist unimodular constants α1, α2 and α3 such that
f(z) = (α1z, α2z, α3z), after a possible reparametrization.
□
Case 2. Each Ai is non-empty, and all Ai are mutually disjoint.
That is, there are three distinct points b1, b2 and b3 on ∂D which are not branch points
of f such that for every i = 1, 2, 3
|fi(z)| →1

|fj(z)| →ri

Therefore, f is an isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)3. By Ng [8], it follows that, up to
reparametrization, f is either the cube root embedding or f can be factorized as
f(z) = (α1(z), α2(β1(z)), β2(β1(z))) ,
where z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) is a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 for i = 1, 2.
Conversely, if up to a reparametrization, f is the cube root embedding, then each Ai
is non-empty and all Ai are mutually disjoint. Let us now look at the latter possibility.
Assume that f = (α1, α2 ◦β1, β2 ◦β1). For i = 1, 2, deﬁne
Γαi = {b ∈∂D : b is not a branch point of z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) and |αi(z)| →1 as z →b},
and similarly
Γβi = {b ∈∂D : b is not a branch point of z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) and |βi(z)| →1 as z →b}.
By Ng [8], every holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 is, up to reparametriza-
tions, a square root embedding. Therefore, Γαi and Γβi are non-empty disjoint subsets of
∂D for both i = 1, 2. So, A1 is non-empty and all Ai are mutually disjoint. For both A2,
A3 to be non-empty, β1(Γβ1) must have non-empty intersection with both Γα2 and Γβ2.
Therefore, if we take any reparametrization of (α1, α2 ◦β1, β2 ◦β1), then all Ai are mu-
tually disjoint but for each Ai to be non-empty, β1(Γβ1) must have non-empty intersection
with both Γα2 and Γβ2.
Example 4.3. Let g = (g1, g2) : (H, ds2
H) →(H, ds2
H)2 be the square root embedding
deﬁned by
g(z) = (z1/2, eiπ/2z1/2),
where if z = reiθ with r > 0 and 0 < θ < π then z1/2 = r1/2eiθ/2. The points 0 and ∞are
the branch points of g. As z →z0 ∈∂H, where z0 is not a branch point of g,
g1(z) →∂H = R only if z0 ∈R+
and
g2(z) →∂H = R only if z0 ∈R−.
Also, g1(R+) = R+ and g2(R−) = R−. Let ϕ : H →D be the biholomorphism given by
ϕ(z) = z −i
1 −iz,
z ∈H.
The map G = (G1, G2) = (ϕ, ϕ)◦g◦ϕ−1 : (D, ds2
D) →(D, ds2
D)2 is a holomorphic isometry.
Let H+ and H−denote the right and left half planes respectively. Then, ϕ(R+) = ∂D∩H+
and ϕ(R−) = ∂D ∩H−. Therefore, −i and i are the branch points of G. And, for every
z0 ∈∂D which is not a branch point of G, we have as z →z0 ∈∂D that
G1(z) →∂D only if z0 ∈∂D ∩H+
and
G2(z) →∂D only if z0 ∈∂D ∩H−.
Also, G1(∂D ∩H+) = ∂D ∩H+ and G2(∂D ∩H−) = ∂D ∩H−. Take (α1, β1) = G and
(α2, β2) = G◦(eiπ/2). Here, β1(Γβ1) = Γβ1 = ∂D∩H−, Γα2 = e−iπ/2 Γα1 = e−iπ/2(∂D∩H+)
and Γβ2 = e−iπ/2 Γβ1 = e−iπ/2(∂D ∩H−). Therefore, β1(Γβ1) has non-empty intersection
with both Γα2 and Γβ2.
Hence, up to reparametrization, f is either the cube root embedding or f can be
factorized as
f(z) = (α1(z), α2(β1(z)), β2(β1(z)))
where z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) is a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 for both
i = 1, 2 such that β1(Γβ1) has non-empty intersection with both Γα2 and Γβ2.

Case 3. Exactly one of the sets Ai is empty, and the other two are mutually disjoint.
Without loss of generality, assume that A1 ∩A2 = ∅= A3, but A1, A2 ̸= ∅. That is,
there are two distinct points b1, b2 ∈∂D which are not branch points of f such that for
j = 1, 2 and i ̸= j
|fj(z)| →1
and
|fi(z)| →ri
j < 1

Note that the vanishing order of 1 −fj(z)fj(bj) at z = bj equals to one for both j = 1, 2.
On comparing the vanishing order at bj in the equation, we obtain d1 = d2 = d. It,
therefore, follows from Theorem 1.2 that d3 = d. Hence, f is an isometry from (D, ds2
D)
to (D, ds2
D)3. By Ng [8], we conclude that, up to reparametrizations, f is either the cube
root embedding or f can be factorized as
f(z) = (α1(z), α2(β1(z)), β2(β1(z)))
where z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) is a holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 for i = 1, 2.
For every reparametrization of the cube root embedding each Ai is non-empty. This
rules out the ﬁrst possibility as one of the sets Ai must be empty.
Let us now look at the other possibility. Assume that f = (α1, α2 ◦β1, β2 ◦β1). All Ai
are mutually disjoint and A1 ̸= ∅. For A3 = ∅, we must have β1(Γβ1) ∩Γβ2 = ∅. Since
Γα2∪Γβ2 is ∂D minus ﬁnitely many points (branch points), we must have β1(Γβ1)∩Γα2 ̸= ∅
and therefore A2 ̸= ∅.
Therefore, if we take any reparametrization of (α1, α2 ◦β1, β2 ◦β1), then all Ai are
mutually disjoint and at least two of the sets Ai are non-empty. For one of the sets Ai to
be empty, we must have that either β1(Γβ1) ∩Γα2 = ∅or β1(Γβ1) ∩Γβ2 = ∅.
Example 4.4. Take (α1, β1) = G and (α2, β2) = G ◦(eiπ), where G is as in Example 4.3.
Here, β1(Γβ1) = Γβ1 = ∂D∩H−, Γα2 = e−iπ Γα1 = ∂D∩H−and Γβ2 = e−iπ Γβ1 = ∂D∩H+.
Therefore, β1(Γβ1) ∩Γβ2 = ∅.
Hence, up to reparametrizations,
f(z) = (α1(z), α2(β1(z)), β2(β1(z))) ,
where for both i = 1, 2, the map z 7→(αi(z), βi(z)) is an isometry from (D, ds2
D) to
(D, ds2
D)2 such that either β1(Γβ1) ∩Γα2 = ∅or β1(Γβ1) ∩Γβ2 = ∅.

Case 4. A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 = ∅, but all the sets A1 ∩A2, A2 ∩A3 and A3 ∩A1 are non-empty.

The vanishing order of 1 −fi(z)fi(bj) at z = bj equals to one for all i ̸= j. On comparing

Therefore, f is an isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)3 with the isometric constant k = 2
(see [8]). By Ng [8], it follows that, up to reparametrizations,
f(z) = (z, α(z), β(z)),
where z 7→(α(z), β(z)) is an isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2. Since Γα ∩Γβ = ∅, at
least one of the sets Ai ∩Aj is empty. Hence, a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not
possible.
□
Case 5. Exactly two pairs (out of the possible three) have non-empty intersection.
Without loss of generality, assume that A1 ∩A3 ̸= ∅̸= A2 ∩A3, but A1 ∩A2 = ∅. That
is, there are two distinct points b1, b2 ∈∂D which are not the branch points of f such that
for j = 1, 2 and i ̸= j
|fi(z)| →1

The vanishing order of 1 −fi(z)fi(bj) at z = bj equals to one for all i ̸= j and j = 1, 2.
On comparing the vanishing order at bj in the equation, we obtain
d + 1 =
X
i=1,3
(di + 1) =

(di + 1).
Therefore, d1 = d2. Let if possible, A1 \ A3 ̸= ∅. Since A1 ∩A2 = ∅, we have d1 = d. But
then d3 = −1, which is a contradiction. Similarly, we cannot have A2 \ A3 ̸= ∅. Thus,
both the sets A1 and A2 are contained in A3. Note that we also have A3 \ (A1 ∪A2) = ∅.
Otherwise d3 = d and therefore d1 = d2 = −1, hence a contradiction. Therefore, for every
b ∈∂D which is not a branch point of f, we have
|f3(z)| →1
as
z →b.
Since f3 is a continuous function from D to D and f has only ﬁnitely many branch
points, |f3(z)| →1 whenever z →b ∈∂D. Thus, f3 is a proper holomorphic map and
hence a ﬁnite Blaschke product. As noted earlier, f3 cannot have poles in C. Therefore,
f3(z) = czk for some |c| = 1 and k ≥1. Further, there exists a rational function R such

18

that R(f3(z)) = R(czk) = z. Let m be the degree of R. Then the degree of R(czk) equals
mk. Hence, mk = 1. So, k = 1 (and m = 1). Thus, the functional equation becomes

Therefore, the map (f1, f2) : (D, ds2

D)2 is a holomorphic isometry and f3(z) =
cz for some |c| = 1. Note that, we indeed have A1 ∩A3 ̸= ∅̸= A2 ∩A3 and A1 ∩A2 = ∅.
Hence,
d + 1 =

f(z) = (z, α(z), β(z)),
where z 7→(α(z), β(z)) is an isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2.

Case 6. All Ai are non-empty, and exactly one pair (out of three) has a non-empty inter-
section.
Without loss of generality, let A1 ∩A2 ̸= ∅̸= A3, but A1 ∩A3 = ∅= A2 ∩A3. That is,
there are two distinct points b1, b2 ∈∂D which are not the branch points of f such that
for i = 1, 2, we have
(i) |fi(z)| →1 and |f3(z)| →r1 < 1 as z →b1,
(ii) |fi(z)| →ri
2 < 1 and |f3(z)| →1 as z →b2.
Since f(0) = 0, we have

Note that for i = 1, 2, the vanishing orders of 1 −fi(z)fi(b1) at z = b1 and 1 −f3(z)f3(b2)
at z = b2 are equal to one. On comparing the vanishing orders at b1 and b2 in the equation,
we obtain
(4.1)
X
i=1,2
(di + 1) = d + 1
and
d3 = d.
As noted before, since
3
Y
i=1
(1 −|fi(z)|2)di+1 = (1 −|z|2)d+1,
at least one component function of f takes an inﬁnite value at ∞on each branch of f
and sum of the multiplicities with which ∞is taken by the component functions should
equal 2d+2. Because of the relation (4.1), there are only two possibilities on each branch
of f. First, both f1 and f2 take an inﬁnite value but f3 takes a ﬁnite value at ∞. Second,
only f3 takes an inﬁnite value at ∞. As noted in the proof of Theorem 1.2, each fi has

si distinct branches and each distinct branch repeats itself s/si times. Further, each fi
must take an inﬁnite value at ∞on exactly one of the distinct si branches of fi.
Since both f1 and f2 take an inﬁnite value at ∞together, we must have s1 = s2.
Therefore, f1 and f2 take an inﬁnite value on s/s1 branches of f, and f3 takes an inﬁnite
value at ∞on s/s3 branches of f. Hence, we conclude that
s = s
s1
+ s
s3
,
that is,
1 = 1
s1
+ 1
s3
Since s1 and s3 are positive integers, the only possible value for s1 and s3 is 2. Thus,
s1 = s2 = s3 = 2.
Since the sheeting number of f3 is 2, there exists an isometry z 7→(α(z), β(z)) from
(D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 such that f3 = β (see [8]). Also, (1−|α(z)|2)(1−|β(z)|2) = (1−|z|2).
Therefore,

(1 −|fi(z)|2)di+1 = (1 −|α(z)|2)d+1(1 −|β(z)|2)d+1.
That is,

i=1
(1 −|fi(z)|2)di+1 = (1 −|α(z)|2)d+1.
Since 0 is not a branch point, there exists a local inverse of α on a neighborhood U ⊂D
of 0. So,
2
Y
i=1
(1 −|(fi ◦α−1)(z)|2)di+1 = (1 −|z|2)d+1,
z ∈U
where (d1 + 1) + (d2 + 1) = d + 1. Therefore, z 7→(f1 ◦α−1, f2 ◦α−1) is a germ of a
holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
d; 0) to (D, ds2
d1; 0) × (D, ds2
d2; 0). This germ extends to
a holomorphic isometry to the entire unit disc and maps it into the bidisc (see Section 7).
Since (d1+1)+(d2+1) = d+1, we therefore conclude from Case 1 that (fi ◦α−1)(z) = ciz
for some unimodular constants ci ∈C. Thus, we have proved that
(f1, f2, f3) = (c1α, c2α, β)
for some isometry z 7→(α(z), β(z)) from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2 and unimodular constants
ci ∈C. Note that, we indeed have A1 ∩A2 ̸= ∅̸= A3 and A1 ∩A3 = ∅= A2 ∩A3.
Hence,
dk1 = d
and
X
i=2,3
(dki + 1) = d + 1,
where ki ̸= kj for i ̸= j and ki ∈{1, 2, 3}. Further, permutations of functions of the
form f = (cα, α, β), where c ∈C is a unimodular constant and z 7→(α(z), β(z)) is a
holomorphic isometry from (D, ds2
D) to (D, ds2
D)2, are all the examples of isometries in this
case.

Without loss of generality, let A1 ∩A2 ̸= ∅and A3 = ∅. That is, there is a point b ∈∂D

(di + 1) = d + 1.
Observe that if A1 \ A2 ̸= ∅, then d1 = d, and hence d2 = −1, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, A1 \ A2 = ∅. Similarly, A2 \ A1 = ∅and hence A1 = A2.
By the hypothesis, A3 = ∅. Thus, if b ∈∂D is not a branch point of f, then |fi(z)| →1
as z →b for both i = 1, 2.
Since f1 and f2 are continuous functions from D to D
and f has only ﬁnitely many branch points, |fi(z)| →1 whenever z →b ∈∂D for
both i = 1, 2. Thus, f1 and f2 are proper holomorphic maps and hence ﬁnite Blaschke
products. As noted earlier, neither f1 nor f2 can have poles in C. Therefore, f1(z) = c1zm

The right hand side is a ﬁnite sum of the norm squares of monomial functions and the

Hence, a contradiction.
Therefore, this case is not
possible.

Without loss of generality, let A1 = A2 = ∅. That is, if b ∈∂D is not a branch point of

D to D and f has only ﬁnitely many branch points, |f3(z)| →1 whenever z →b ∈∂D.
Thus, f3 is a proper holomorphic map and hence a ﬁnite Blaschke product. As observed

Let V 1 denote the irreducible one-dimensional projective analytic subvariety in P1×(P1)n
extending the graph of F 1 and π be the projection of V 1 onto the ﬁrst coordinate. There
exists a discrete set A ⊂P1 such that π, when restricted to V 1 \ π−1(A), is a holomorphic
covering with s branches.
Suppose (z1, a1, . . . , an) is a point on V 1 with z1 ∈C and ai = ∞. Let U ⊂C\(A ∪{z1})
be an open set such that π−1(U) = Ss
l=1 Wl, where Wl’s are disjoint. Take any of the

dl+1 = a(1 −z1 ¯w)c1+1.
Since the right-hand side is always ﬁnite and ai = ∞, either fi ≡0 or (1 −ajfj) ≡0 on
U for some j. Since ∂fi/∂z1 is not identically zero, the former cannot be true. The latter
possibility is also ruled out as the right side is not identically zero. This is a contradiction.
Therefore, fi(z1, . . . , zm), as a function of z1, can take the value inﬁnity only at z1 = ∞.
Since fi, as a function of z1, is not identically constant, the projection of the analytic
subvariety corresponding to the component function fi onto the second coordinate is
all of P1. Therefore, fi(∞, z2, . . . , zm) = ∞for all (z2, . . . , zm) ∈Dm−1. Since (3.6) is
invariant under the involution (z, h) 7→(1/z, 1/h), it follows that fi(0, z2, . . . , zm) = 0 for
all (z2, . . . , zm) ∈Dm−1.

Lemma 6.2. Let W ⊂C be an open set and (fw,1(z), fw,2(z), . . . , fw,n(z)) a family of
holomorphic functions on D depending holomorphically on w ∈W such that

where ai’s and k are non-negative integers. Then, for all i, ∂fw,i
∂w ≡0.
Proof. For every w ∈W, let Fw denote the isometry with component functions fw,i,
1 ≤i ≤n. We can determine the analytic subvariety extending the graph of Fw, in the
same way as in Proposition 3.2. The proof of this proposition shows that the analytic
subvariety is independent of w. Therefore, Fw is also independent of w. Hence, ∂fw,i
∂w ≡0
for all i.
□
By Lemma 6.1, if for any i ≤n, ∂fi
∂z1 is not constantly zero, then fi(0, z2, . . . , zm) = 0
for all (z2, . . . , zm) ∈Dm−1. It follows from the functional equation

that we can not have fi(0, z2, . . . , zm) = 0 for all i ≤n and (z2, . . . , zm) ∈Dm−1. After
rearranging the component indices, if necessary, we can assume that there exists a postive
integer n1 such that

Then, we can write fi(z1, z2, . . . , zm) = fi(z2, . . . , zm) for all n1 + 1 ≤i ≤n. On substi-

So, we now have a holomorphic family (with parameters z2, . . . , zm) of holomorphic func-
tions satisfying the above functional equation in z1. It follows from Lemma 6.2, that
for all 1 ≤i ≤n1, fi is a function of z1 only.
Note that (f1, . . . , fn1) : (D, ds2
c1) →
(D, ds2
d1) × · · · × (D, ds2
dn1) is a holomorphic isometry. We can now argue in the same way
for the variable z2 in (6.4). By induction, this completes the proof of the ﬁrst part of the
theorem.
It now follows from Theorem 1.2 that for all 1 ≤i ≤m,

7. Appendix
Let d1, d2, . . . , dn be an n-tuple of non-negative integers. As before, let µdi denote the
weight K−di
D
on D and KD,di the weighted Bergman kernel corresponding to the weight
µdi. Consider the polydisc Dn endowed with the weight
µ(z) = µ(z1, z2, . . . , zn) = µd1(z1) · µd2(z2) · · · µdn(zn)
which is the point-wise product of the weights in each factor.
Note that each µdi is
an admissible weight on D, and the explicit prescription of µ shows that it is also an
admissible weight on Dn.
Using the reproducing property, it can be seen that
KDn,µ((z1, . . . , zn), (ζ1, . . . , ζn)) = KD,d1(z1, ζ1) · · ·KD,dn(zn, ζn)
for (z1, . . . , zn), (ζ1, . . . , ζn) ∈Dn.
In other words, the multiplicative property of the
Bergman kernel holds for this class of weights on D. We do not know whether this is true
for general admissible weights on arbitrary domains.
What this means for the situation in the proof of second part of Theorem 1.2 is that
the isometry condition on the germ
g : (D, ds2
d; x0) →(D, ds2
d1; y01) × · · · × (D, ds2
dn; y0n)
which can be a priori written as

d(z) = ds2
d1(g1(z)) + . . . + ds2
dn(gn(z))
or equivalently
∂∂log KD,d(z) = ∂∂log KD,d1(g1(z)) + . . . + ∂∂log KD,dn(gn(z))
for z ∈D close to x0, can now be translated as

is a germ of a holomorphic isometry.
In order to see that the germ g of an isometric embedding of the unit disc into a polydisc
can be extended over the whole unit disc, ﬁrst apply Kobayashi’s embedding of a domain
Ω⊂Cn isometrically in the projectivization of a separable Hilbert space – the proof from
[4] works verbatim in the weighted case and we merely state the result that can be used.
Theorem 7.1. Let Ω⊂Cn be a domain and µ be an admissible weight on Ω.
Let
H = Oµ(Ω) and H∗be its dual space, i.e., the space of all the linear functionals on H.
Assume that the weight µ is such that
A1. For every z1, z2 ∈Ω, there exists an f ∈H such that f(z1) = 0 and f(z2) ̸= 0.
A2. For every z ∈Ωand X ∈Cn, there exists an f ∈H such that f(z) = 0 and
|f ′(z) · X| ̸= 0.
Let P(H∗) denote the projectivization of the separable Hilbert space H∗. Then there exists
a canonical complex analytic isometrical imbedding Φ : (Ω, ds2
Ω,µ) →(P(H∗), ds2
F S), where
ds2
F S is the Fubini-Study metric.
It is not diﬃcult to see that both conditions listed above are satisﬁed in the case of the
product weight µ on Dn by using its explicit expression.
In Theorem 7.1, take Ω= Dn and µ as before. Since composition of two isometries is
an isometry, the map Φ ◦g : (D, ds2
d; x0) →(P(H∗), ds2
F S; Φ(y0)) is a local holomorphic
isometry. Since ds2
d is a real-analytic K¨ahler metric, it follows by Calabi’s theorem [1]
that Φ ◦g admits an extension to a holomorphic isometry Ψ : D →P(H∗).
Analytically continuing Φ◦g gives an analytic continuation of Graph(g) (which is locally
deﬁned near x0 as a germ to begin with) to a complex-analytic subvariety of D × Dn, as
any point (z, a1, . . . , an) in the anaytic continuation of g along a loop satisﬁes
(1 −|z|2)d+1 =
n
Y
i=1
(1 −|ai|2)di+1.
Since (Dn, µ) is complete and isometrically embedded in P(H∗) via Φ, Ψ(D) ⊂Φ(Dn).
This gives the existence of a holomorphic isometry F : (D, ds2
d) →(D, ds2
d1)×· · ·×(D, ds2
dn)
that extends the germ of f.
Going back to the proof of Theorem 1.2, let (z0, a1, . . . , an) ∈V \ π−1(A). Choose a
neighborhood U0 of z0 lying in D or P1 \D depending upon whether z0 ∈D or z0 ∈P1 \D.
There exist holomorphic functions hi on U0 with (z, h1(z), · · · , hn(z)) ∈V for all z ∈U0.
Since
n

i=1
 1 −|hi(z)|2di+1 =
 1 −|z|2d+1 ,
either hi(U0) ⊂D or hi(U0) ⊂P1\D for 1 ≤i ≤n. We now study the two cases separately.
Case 1. Let z0 ∈D. Deﬁne holomorphic functions gi on U0 as follows
gi(z) =
(
hi(z)
if hi(U0) ⊂D
1/hi(z)
if hi(U0) ⊂P1 \ D .

26

Assume that only h1(U0) ⊂P1 \ D. Note that d1 must be an odd. So, we obtain
n
X
i=1
(di + 1) log(1 −|gi(z)|2) −(d1 + 1) log |g1(z)|2 = (d + 1) log(1 −|z|2).
Applying ∂¯∂to both sides, the second term on the left hand side vanishes and we get
n

i=1
(di + 1)
|g′
i(z)|2
(1 −|gi(z)|2)2 =
d + 1
(1 −|z|2)2,
which is same as saying
n
X
i=1
∂¯∂log KD,di(gi) = ∂¯∂log KD,d(z).
Other cases can be handled similarly to see that (g1, . . . , gn) is a germ of a holomorphic
isometry and hence can be extended to a holomorphic isometry over the whole unit disc.
Thus, we also have the extension of the functions hi over the whole unit disc such that
(z, h1(z), . . . , hn(z)) ∈V for all z ∈D.
□
Case 2. Let z0 ∈P1 \ D. Let V0 = {z ∈D : 1/z ∈U0}. Deﬁne holomorphic functions gi
on V0 as follows
gi(z) =
(
hi(1/z)
if hi(U0) ⊂D
1/hi(1/z)
if hi(U0) ⊂P1 \ D .
Assume that only h1(U0) ⊂P1 \ D. Note that both d1 and d must be either odd or even.
For all z ∈V0, we therefore obtain
n
X
i=1
(di + 1) log(1 −|gi(z)|2) −(d1 + 1) log |g1(z)|2 = (d + 1) log(1 −|z|2) −(d + 1) log |z|2.
Applying ∂¯∂to both sides, the second term on both the sides vanish and we get
n
X
i=1
(di + 1)
|g′
i(z)|2
(1 −|gi(z)|2)2 =
d + 1
(1 −|z|2)2,
which is same as saying
n
X
i=1
∂¯∂log KD,di(gi) = ∂¯∂log KD,d(z).
Other cases can be handled similarly to see that (g1, . . . , gn) is a germ of a holomorphic
isometry and hence can be extended to a holomorphic isometry over the whole unit disc.
Thus, we also have the extension of the functions hi over the whole P1 \ D such that
(z, h1(z), . . . , hn(z)) ∈V for all z ∈P1 \ D.

8. Concluding Remarks and Questions
Theorems 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 all deal with isometries with respect to the weighted
metrics ds2
D,d. This metric provides a canonical class of metrics that give rise to conformal
constants in the functional equations that arise from the isometry condition. In the same
way, it would be interesting to explore a weighted analog of [7] that deals with isometries
from the ball into the product of two balls, all living in possibly diﬀerent dimensions.
Further, Mok–Ng [6] and Yuan [11] have also considered germs of measure preserving
holomorphic maps. Obtaining analogs of these results in the context of measures arising
from the volume forms associated with ds2
D,d also seems to be interesting.
