A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR
DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
Abstract. A graph is distance-hereditary if for any pair of vertices, their distance in
every connected induced subgraph containing both vertices is the same as their distance
in the original graph. The Distance-Hereditary Vertex Deletion problem asks,
given a graph G on n vertices and an integer k, whether there is a set S of at most k
vertices in G such that G −S is distance-hereditary. This problem is important due to
its connection to the graph parameter rank-width that distance-hereditary graphs are
exactly graphs of rank-width at most 1. Eiben, Ganian, and Kwon (MFCS’ 16) proved
that Distance-Hereditary Vertex Deletion can be solved in time 2O(k)nO(1), and
asked whether it admits a polynomial kernelization. We show that this problem admits
a polynomial kernel, answering this question positively. For this, we use a similar idea
for obtaining an approximate solution for Chordal Vertex Deletion due to Jansen
and Pilipczuk (SODA’ 17) to obtain an approximate solution with O(k3 log n) vertices
when the problem is a Yes-instance, and we exploit the structure of split decompositions
of distance-hereditary graphs to reduce the total size.
1. Introduction
The graph modiﬁcation problems, in which we want to transform a graph to satisfy
a certain property with as few graph modiﬁcations as possible, have been extensively
studied. For instance, the Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set problems are
graph modiﬁcation problems where the target graphs are edgeless graphs and forests,
respectively. By the classic result of Lewis and Yannakakis [23], it is known that for all
non-trivial hereditary properties that can be tested in polynomial time, the corresponding
vertex deletion problems are NP-hard. Hence, the research eﬀort has been directed toward
designing algorithms such as approximation and parameterized algorithms.
When the target graph class C admits eﬃcient algorithms for some NP-hard problems,
the graph modiﬁcation problem related to such a class attracts more attention. In this
context, vertex deletion problems to classes of graphs of constant tree-width or constant
tree-depth have been studied. Tree-width w Vertex Deletion 1 is proved to admit
an FPT algorithm running in time 2O(k)nO(1) and a kernel with O(kg(w)) vertices for
some function g [15, 22]. Also, it was shown that Tree-depth w Vertex Deletion
admits uniformly polynomial kernels with O(k6) vertices, for every ﬁxed w [16]. All these
problems are categorized as vertex deletion problems for F-minor free graphs in a general

setting, when the set F contains at least one planar graph. However, F-minor free graphs
capture only sparse graphs in a sense that the number of edges of such a graph is bounded
by a linear function on the number of its vertices. Thus these problems are not very useful
when dealing with very dense graphs.
Rank-width [26] and clique-width [7] are graph width parameters introduced for extend-
ing graph classes of bounded tree-width. Graphs of bounded rank-width represent graphs
that can be recursively decomposed along vertex partitions (X, Y ) where the number of
neighborhood types between X and Y are small. Thus, graphs of constant rank-width
may contain dense graphs; for instance, all complete graphs have rank-width at most 1.
Courcelle, Makowski, and Rotics [6] proved that every MSO1-expressible problem can be
solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded rank-width.
Motivated from Tree-width w Vertex Deletion, Eiben, Ganian, and the second
author [10] initiated study on vertex deletion problems to graphs of constant rank-width.
The class of graphs of rank-width at most 1 is exactly same as the class of distance-
hereditary graphs [26].
A graph G is called distance-hereditary if for every connected
induced subgraph H of G and every two vertices u and v in H, the distance between u
and v in H is the same as the distance in G. A vertex subset X of a graph G is a distance-
hereditary modulator, or a DH-modulator in short, if G−X is a distance-hereditary graph.
We formulate our central problem.
Distance-hereditary Vertex Deletion (DH Vertex Deletion)
Input : A graph G, an integer k
Parameter : k
Question : Does G contain a DH-modulator of size at most k?
Eiben, Ganian, and the second author [10] proved that DH Vertex Deletion can be
solved in time 2O(k)nO(1). It was known before that vertex deletion problems for graphs
of rank-width w can be solved in FPT time [21] using the fact that graphs of rank-width
at most w can be characterized by a ﬁnite list of forbidden vertex-minors [26], and Eiben
et al. devised a ﬁrst elementary algorithm for this problem when w = 1. Furthermore,
they discussed that the size k of a DH-modulator can be used to obtain a 2O(k)nO(1)-time
algorithm for problems such as Independent Set, Vertex Cover, and 3-Coloring.
However, until now, it was not known whether the DH Vertex Deletion problem
admits a polynomial kernel or not. A kernelization of a parameterized graph problem Π is
a polynomial-time algorithm which, given an instance (G, k) of Π, outputs an equivalent
instance (G′, k′) of Π with |V (G′)| + k′ ≤h(k) for some computable function h. The
resulting instance (G′, k′) of a kernelization is called a kernel, and in particular, when h
is a polynomial function, Π is said to admit a polynomial kernel.
Our Contribution. In this paper, we show that DH Vertex Deletion admits a poly-
nomial kernel.
Theorem 1.1. DH Vertex Deletion admits a polynomial kernel.
We ﬁnd in Section 3 an approximate DH-modulator with O(k3 log n) vertices if the
given instance is a Yes-instance. An important observation here is that in a distance-
hereditary graph, there is a balanced separator, which is a complete bipartite subgraph
(possibly containing edges in each part). By recursively ﬁnding such separators, we will

decompose the given graph into D⊎K1 ⊎· · ·⊎Kℓ⊎X, where ℓ= O(k log n), D is distance-
hereditary, each Ki is a complete bipartite subgraph, |X| = O(k3√log k log n). We argue
that if a graph H is the disjoint union of a distance-hereditary graph and a complete
bipartite graph, then in polynomial time, one can construct a DH-modulator of size O(k2)
in H if (H, k) is a Yes-instance. Using this sub-algorithm ℓtimes, we will construct an
approximate DH-modulator with O(k3 log n) vertices. This part follows a vein similar to
the approach of Jansen and Pilipczuk [20] for Chordal Vertex Deletion. Given a
DH-modulator S by adding O(k2) per each vertex in S, we will obtain in Section 4 a new
DH-modulator S′ of size O(k5 log n) such that for every v ∈S′, G[(V (G)\S)∪{v}] is also
distance-hereditary. We will call such a DH-modulator a good DH-modulator.
The remaining part is contributed to reduce the number of vertices in G −S′. Note
that distance-hereditary graphs may contain a large set of pairwise twins. In Section 5,
we present a reduction rule that results in bounding the size of each set of pairwise twins
in G −S′. We give in Section 6 a reduction rule that results in bounding the number of
connected components of G −S′. The last step is to reduce the size of each connected
component of G −S′ having at least 2 vertices. For this, we use split decompositions
of distance-hereditary graphs. Brieﬂy, split decompositions present tree-like structure of
distance-hereditary graphs, with a decomposition tree with bags for each nodes, such that
each bag consists of a maximal set of pairwise twins in G−S′. Since the result of Section 5
provides a bound of each maximal set of pairwise twins in G −S′, it is suﬃcient to bound
the number of bags in the decomposition tree. We summarize our algorithm in Section 8,
and conclude with some further discussions in Section 9.
2. Preliminaries
In this paper, all graphs are simple and ﬁnite. Given a graph G, we write the vertex
set and edge set of G as V (G) and E(G) respectively. Unless otherwise stated, we reserve
n to denote |V (G)|. For a vertex v of G, we denote by G −v the graph obtained from G
by removing v and all edges incident with it. For a vertex subset S of G, we denote by
G −S the graph obtained by removing all vertices in S. For a vertex subset S of G, let
G[S] be the subgraph of G induced by S. For a vertex v in G, we denote by NG(v) the
set of all neighbors of v in G. For a vertex subset S of G, we denote by NG(S) the set of
all vertices in V (G) \ S that have a neighbor in S, and let NG[S] := NG(S) ∪S. If the
graph G is clear from the context, then we may remove G from the notation. We say that
a graph is trivial if it consists of a single vertex, and non-trivial otherwise.
For two vertex sets A and B in G, we say A is complete to B if for every v ∈A and
w ∈B, v is adjacent to w, and A is anti-complete to B if for every v ∈A and w ∈B, v is
not adjacent to w. A star is a tree with a distinguished vertex, called the center, adjacent
to all other vertices. A complete graph is a graph with all possible edges. Two vertices v
and w of a graph G are twins if they have the same neighbors in G −{v, w}. We say a
vertex subset S of G is a twin set of G if the vertices in S are pairwise twins in G.
A graph H is a biclique if there is a bipartition of V (H) into non-empty sets A ⊎B
such that any two vertices a ∈A and b ∈B is adjacent. Notice that there may be edges
among the vertices of A or B. For a vertex subset K ⊆V (G), we say that K is a biclique
of G if G[K] is a biclique.
For a connected graph G, a vertex subset S ⊆V (G) is called a balanced vertex separator
of G if every component of G −S has at most 2
3|V (G)| vertices. We allow V (G) to be

a trivial balanced vertex separator of G. For a vertex subset S of G, a path is called an
S-path if its end vertices are in S and all other internal vertices are in V (G) \ S.
2.1. Distance-hereditary graphs. A graph G is distance-hereditary if for every con-
nected induced subgraph H of G, the distance between u and v in H is the same as the
distance between u and v in G. The class of distance-hereditary graphs was introduced
by Howorka [19], and attracted much attention after the work of Bandelt and Murder [3]
in 1982.
This graph class was characterized in a various way; for instance, distance-
hereditary graphs are exactly the graphs that can be constructed from a vertex by a
sequence of adding twins or leaves [3], or these graphs are (5, 2)-crossing chordal graphs
meaning that every induced cycle of length at least 5 contains two crossing chords [19].
A graph is called a DH obstruction if it is isomorphic to a gem, a house, a domino or
an induced cycle of length at least 5, that are depicted in Figure 1. A DH obstruction is
small if it has at most 6 vertices.
Theorem 2.1 (Bandelt and Mulder [3]). A graph is distance-hereditary if and only if it
has no induced subgraph isomorphic to one of DH obstructions.
The following lemma from [21] is useful to ﬁnd a DH obstruction.
Lemma 2.2. Given a graph G, if P is an induced path in G of length at least 3 and
v ∈V (G) \ V (P) is adjacent with the end vertices of P, then G[V (P) ∪{v}] contains a
DH obstruction including v.
For a subset S of a graph G, we say that S is a DH-modulator if G −S is distance-
hereditary. A DH-modulator S is good if every DH obstruction of G contains at least two
vertices of S, or equivalently, G[(V (G) \ S) ∪{v}] is distance-hereditary for every v ∈S.
2.2. Split decompositions. We follow the notations in [4]. A split of a graph G is a
vertex partition (A, B) of G such that |A| ≥2, |B| ≥2, and NG(B) is complete to NG(A).
A connected graph G is called a prime graph if |V (G)| ≥5 and it has no split. A connected
graph D with a distinguished set of cut edges M(D) of D is called a marked graph if M(D)
forms a matching. An edge in M(D) is called a marked edge, and every other edge is called
an unmarked edge. A vertex incident with a marked edge is called a marked vertex, and
every other vertex is called an unmarked vertex. Each connected component of D −M(D)
is called a bag of D. See Figure 2 for an example.
When G admits a split (A, B), we construct a marked graph D on the vertex set
V (G) ∪{a′, b′} such that
• a′b′ is a new marked edge,
• A is anti-complete to B,
• {a′} is complete to NG(B), {b′} is complete to NG(A), and
• for vertices a, b with {a, b} ⊆A or {a, b} ⊆B, ab ∈E(G) if and only if ab ∈E(D).

Figure 2. An example of a split decomposition of a distance-hereditary
graph. Dashed edges denote marked edges and each Bi denotes a bag.
The marked graph D is called a simple decomposition of G. A split decomposition of a
connected graph G is a marked graph D deﬁned inductively to be either G or a marked
graph deﬁned from a split decomposition D′ of G by replacing a bag B with its simple
decomposition. It is known that for two vertices u, v in G, uv ∈E(G) if and only if there is
a path from u to v in D where its ﬁrst and last edges are unmarked, and an unmarked edge
and a marked edge alternatively appear in the path [1, Lemma 2.10]. For convenience, we
call a bag a star bag or a complete bag if it is a star or a complete graph, respectively.
Naturally, we can deﬁne a reverse operation of decomposing into a simple decomposition;
for a marked edge xy of a split decomposition D, recomposing xy is the operation of
removing two vertices x and y and making ND(x) \ {y} complete to ND(y) \ {x} with
unmarked edges. It is not hard to observe that if D is a split decomposition of G, then G
can be obtained from D by recomposing all marked edges.
Note that there are many ways of decomposing a complete graph or a star, because
every its vertex partition (A, B) with |A| ≥2 and |B| ≥2 is a split. Cunningham and
Edmonds [8] developed a canonical way to decompose a graph into a split decomposition
by not allowing to decompose a star bag or a complete bag. A split decomposition D
of G is called a canonical split decomposition if each bag of D is either a prime graph, a
star, or a complete graph, and recomposing any marked edge of D violates this property.
Bouchet [4, (4.3)] observed that every canonical split decomposition has no marked edge
linking two complete bags, and no marked edge linking a leaf of a star bag and the center
of another star bag. Furthermore, for each pair of twins a, b in G, it holds that a, b must
both be located in the same bag of the canonical split decomposition.
Theorem 2.3 (Cunningham and Edmonds [8]). Every connected graph has a unique
canonical split decomposition, up to isomorphism.
Theorem 2.4 (Dahlhaus [9]). The canonical split decomposition of a graph G can be
computed in time O(|V (G)| + |E(G)|).
We now give the second characterization of distance-hereditary graphs that is crucial
for our results.
Theorem 2.5 (Bouchet [4]). A graph is distance-hereditary if and only if every bag in its
canonical split decomposition is either a star bag or a complete bag.
2.3. Extending a canonical split decomposition. Let G and H be connected graphs
such that G is distance-hereditary and H is obtained from G by adding a vertex v. Gioan
and Paul [17] characterized when H is again distance-hereditary or not, and described the
way to extend the canonical split decomposition of G to the canonical split decomposition
of H when H is distance-hereditary. We need this characterization in Section 7.

Figure 3. The way of extending the given split decomposition by adding
a new vertex v. The pointed position is the marked edge described in (2)
of Theorem 2.6, and it can be computed in polynomial time. The second
split decomposition is the modiﬁed split decomposition.
Let D be the canonical split decomposition of a connected distance-hereditary graph G.
For S ⊆V (G) and a vertex v in D with a bag B containing v, v is accessible with respect
to S if either v ∈S, or the component of D −V (B) having a neighbor of v contains a
vertex in S. For S ⊆V (G) and a bag B of D,
(1) B is fully accessible with respect to S if all vertices in B are accessible with respect
to S,
(2) B is singly accessible with respect to S if B is a star bag of D, and exactly two
vertices of B including the center of B are accessible with respect to S, and
(3) B is partially accessible with respect to S if otherwise.
A star bag B of D is oriented towards a bag B′ (or a marked edge e) in D if the center of
B is marked, and the path from the center of B to a vertex of B′ (or to end vertices of e)
contain the marked edge incident with the center of B. For S ⊆V (G), we deﬁne D(S) as
the minimal connected subdecomposition of D such that
(1) D(S) is induced by the union of a set of bags of D, and
(2) D(S) contains all vertices of S.
Theorem 2.6 (Gioan and Paul, Theorem 3.4 of [17]). Let G and H be connected graphs
such that G is distance-hereditary and H is obtained from G by adding a vertex v. Let
NH(v) = S. Then H is distance-hereditary if and only if at most one bag of D(S) is
partially accessible in D, and
(1) if there is a partially accessible bag B in D(S), then each star bag B′ ̸= B in D(S) is
oriented towards B if and only if it is fully accessible,
(2) otherwise, there exists a marked edge e of D(S) such that each star bag B in D(S) is
oriented towards e if and only if it is fully accessible.
Furthermore, we can ﬁnd the partially accessible bag B in (1) or the marked edge e in (2)
in time O(|V (G)|). 2
In Section 4.1 of [17], Gioan and Paul explained how to obtain a canonical split decom-
position of H from D using such a partially accessible bag or a marked edge. Since it is
suﬃcient to ﬁnd such a bag or a marked edge for our purpose, we will not describe how to
update it, but we give an example in Figure 3. One important property is that for every
2Theorem 3.4 of [17] presented one more condition that every complete bag is either fully or partially
accessible, which is redundant by deﬁnition.

two vertices in a bag of D that is not the partially accessible bag, they are still twins in
H.
3. Approximation algorithm
We present a polynomial-time algorithm which constructs an approximate DH-modulator
of G whenever (G, k) is a Yes-instance for DH Vertex Deletion. The main result is
as follows.
Theorem 3.1. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given a graph G and a positive
integer k, either correctly reports that (G, k) is a No-instance to DH Vertex Deletion,
or returns a DH-modulator S ⊆V (G) of size O(k3 · log n).
Recall that a DH obstruction is said to be small if it contains at most 6 vertices. If G
contains k +1 vertex-disjoint copies of small DH obstructions, then (G, k) is clearly a No-
instance. Therefore, we may assume that a maximal packing of small DH obstructions in G
has cardinality at most k. Notice that after removing all the vertices in a maximal packing,
the resulting graph has no small DH obstruction. The following is the key statement for
proving Theorem 3.1 and most part of this section is devoted to its proof.
Proposition 3.2. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given a graph G without
a small DH obstruction and a positive integer k, either correctly reports that (G, k) is a
No-instance to DH Vertex Deletion, or returns a DH-modulator S ⊆V (G) of size
O(k3 · log n).
A recent work of Jansen and Pilipczuk [20] for a polynomial kernel for Chordal Ver-
tex Deletion employs an approximation algorithm as an important subroutine. We
follow a similar vein of approach as in [20] here. The crux is to reduce the problem of ﬁnd-
ing an approximate DH-modulator to a restricted version where an input instance comes
with a biclique DH-modulator (which we call a controlled instance). In this special case,
ﬁnding an approximate DH-modulator boils down to solving Vertex Multicut. We con-
struct an instance of Vertex Multicut using a feasible solution to the LP relaxation of
DH Vertex Deletion. To this end, we obtain a decomposition
V (G) = D ⊎Kℓ⊎· · · K1 ⊎Xℓ⊎· · · X1
where G[D] is distance-hereditary, each Ki is a biclique, |Xi| = O(k√log k) and ℓ=
O(k·log n), if (G, k) is a Yes-instance (Proposition 3.10). Such a decomposition is achieved
by recursively extracting pairs (K, X) from G, where K is a biclique, X is a vertex set
of size at most O(k√log k) until the resulting graph after removing those sets is distance-
hereditary. Then in the graph G[D ⊎Kℓ⊎· · · K1], we recursively ﬁnd an approximate
DH-modulator using the algorithm for a controlled instance.
As we consider distance-hereditary graphs instead of chordal graphs, our approximation
algorithm makes some important deviations from [20]. First, we extract a pair containing
a biclique, instead of a clique. Second, unlike in [20], we cannot guarantee that a long
induced cycle traverses exactly one connected component of the distance-hereditary graph
D. Such diﬀerences call for nontrivial tweaks in our approximation.
Except for the last subsection in which we prove Theorem 3.1, we assume that G
contains no small DH obstruction.

3.1. LP relaxation and preprocessing. Given a graph G, let x be a mapping from
V (G) to R and denote x(v) as xv for every v ∈V (G). For a subgraph H of G, we deﬁne
x(H) := P
v∈V (H) xv and |x| := x(G). As we assume that G does not contain any small
DH obstructions, the following is a linear program formulation of DH Vertex Deletion
for an instance (G, k):
min
X
v
xv
s.t
x(H) ≥1
∀H is an induced cycle of length at least 7
xv ≥0
∀v ∈V (G).
It is clear that an optimal integral solution corresponds to an optimal DH-modulator and
vice versa. We call a feasible solution to this LP a feasible fractional solution to DH
Vertex Deletion (for G).
Observation 3.3. If x∗is a feasible fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion for
a graph G, then for any induced subgraph G′ of G, x∗restricted to V (G′) is a feasible
fractional solution for G′ as well.
An optimal fractional solution x∗to DH Vertex Deletion can be found in polynomial
time using the ellipsoid method3 provided that there is a separation oracle for detecting
a violated constraint for a fractional solution x′. Such a separation oracle can be easily
implemented in polynomial time.
Lemma 3.4. Let G be a graph with non-negative weights x′ : V (G) →Q≥0 and ℓ∈Q≥0.
For any positive integer d, one can decide in time O(nd+2) whether there is an induced
cycle H of length at least d with x′(H) < ℓ.
Proof. For every size-d vertex subset D of G such that G[D] is an induced path, with s and
t as end vertices, we solve a weighted shortest-path problem on G′ with weights x′|V (G′),
where G′ is obtained by removing all internal vertices of D and their neighbors, except for
s and t. Clearly, D together with the obtained shortest (s, t)-path forms an induced cycle
of length at least d. Conversely, if there is an induced cycle of length at least d, then it
can be detected by considering all size-d vertex subsets.

Let x∗be an optimal fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion for G and let ˜X be
the set of all vertices v such that x∗

20. Observe
(1)
k ≥x∗(G) ≥1
20 · | ˜X| + x∗(G −˜X)
From Inequality (1), it is easy to see that if | ˜X| > 20k, then (G, k) is a No-instance.
Therefore, we may assume that | ˜X| ≤20k. Furthermore, by Observation 3.3, x∗restricted
to V (G)\ ˜X is a feasible fractional solution for G−˜X and x∗
v < 1
20 for every v ∈V (G)\ ˜X.
We add ˜X to the approximate DH-modulator S we are constructing and remove ˜X from G.
Henceforth, we assume that x∗is a feasible fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion
for G such that x∗
v < 1

3.2. Decomposition into DH and bicliques. Using the following observations, we
decompose the vertex set of G into bicliques, a set inducing a distance-hereditary graph,
and a bounded number of extra vertices.
We ﬁrst prove an O(n3) bound on the number of maximal bicliques in a graph having
no small DH obstructions. This can be seen as an extension of an O(n2) bound on the
number of maximal cliques in graphs without C4 [13, Proposition 2] or an O(n√n) bound
for graphs without C4 and the diamond [12, Theorem 2.1]. The tightness of the latter
result was also conﬁrmed. We say two sets A and B cross if A \ B ̸= ∅, A ∩B ̸= ∅, and
B \ A ̸= ∅.
Lemma 3.5. Let A be a set and let C = {C1, . . . , Cm} be a family of subsets of A such
that for each distinct integers i, j ∈{1, . . . , m}, Ci ̸= Cj and Ci and Cj do not cross.
Then m ≤|A|(|A|+1)
2
.
Proof. We may assume |A| ≥2. Let v ∈A. Note that the sets in C containing v can be
ordered linearly by the inclusion relation. Therefore, there are at most |A| sets containing
v. By induction {Ci ∈C : v /∈Ci} contains at most (|A|−1)|A|
2
elements. Thus, in total,
|C| ≤|A|(|A|+1)
2
.

Lemma 3.6. Let G be a graph on n vertices that has no small DH obstructions. Then
G contains at most n3+5n
6
maximal bicliques, and they can be enumerated in polynomial
time.
Proof. We claim that every vertex is contained at most (n−1)n
2
+1 maximal bicliques of G.
Then by recursively enumerating all maximal bicliques containing v of G and discarding
v from G, we obtain the bound P

on the number of maximal
bicliques in total.
Let v ∈V (G), and let N1 := NG(v) and let N2 be the set of vertices in G−({v}∪NG(v))
that have a neighbor in N1. We claim that for w, z ∈N2, NG(w) ∩N1 and NG(z) ∩N1
do not cross. Suppose for contradiction that there exists w, z ∈N2 where NG(w) ∩N1
and NG(z) ∩N1 cross.
By deﬁnition, there exists a1 ∈(NG(w) \ NG(z)) ∩N1, a2 ∈
(NG(w) ∩NG(z)) ∩N1, and a3 ∈(NG(z) \ NG(w)) ∩N1. If wz ∈E(G), then regardless of
the adjacency between a1 and a3, G[{w, z, a1, a3, v}] is isomorphic to C5 or the house. We
may assume wz /∈E(G). If a1a3 ∈E(G), then G[{w, z, a1, a2, a3}] is isomorphic to C5,
the house, or the gem. If a1a3 /∈E(G), then G[{v, w, z, a1, a2, a3}] contains an induced
subgraph isomorphic to the domino, the house, or the gem. Therefore, we can always ﬁnd
a small DH obstruction. We conclude that for w, z ∈N2, NG(w) ∩N1 and NG(z) ∩N1 do
not cross, as G has no small DH obstructions.
So, {NG(v) ∩N1 : v ∈N2} forms a family of sets such that any two sets do not cross.
Since |N1| ≤|V (G)| −1, by Lemma 3.5, it contains at most (n−1)n
2
sets.
Notice that every biclique containing v and a vertex in N2 should consists of one part
with the union of v and a set of vertices in N2 having the same neighbors on N1. Thus,
the number of such bicliques is at most (n−1)n
2
. With the maximal biclique containing
the trivial biclique with the partitions {v} and N1, there are at most (n−1)n
2
+ 1 bicliques
containing v, as required. Furthermore, by classfying the classes of vertices in N2 having
the same neighborhoods in N1, we can enumerate all bicliques in polynomial time.

One main observation is that every connected distance-hereditary graph admits a bi-
clique that is also a balanced vertex separator. We prove this.
Lemma 3.7. Let G be a connected distance-hereditary graph on at least two vertices.
Then G contains a blicique that is a balanced vertex separator of G.
Proof. Let D be a canonical split decomposition of G. If D consists of a single bag B, then
B = G. Note that B is either a star or a complete graph on at least two vertices. In this
case, we take the whole vertex set V (G) as a balanced vertex separator of G. Henceforth,
we can assume that D contains at least two bags.
For every marked edge e = xy of D, let Ux(e) (respectively, Uy(e)) denote the set
of unmarked vertices contained in the connected component of D −e containing x (re-
spectively, y). Recall that (Ux(e), Uy(e)) deﬁnes a split of G. Let Rx(e) := NG(Uy(e)),
Ry(e) := NG(Ux(e)), and Ke := Rx(e) ∪Ry(e). We note that a vertex v belongs to Ry(e)
if and only if v is an unmarked vertex in D that is connected to y by an odd-length path
in D −e alternating in marked edges and unmarked edges. Since (Ux(e), Uy(e)) is a split,
the vertex set Ke forms a biclique.
Let ⃗D be a graph obtained by orienting every marked edge e = xy from x to y whenever
G[Uy(e) \ Ry(e)] contains a connected component of size larger than 1
2n. Note that a
connected component of G[Uy(e) \ Ry(e)] is a connected component of G −Ke. If there is
an unoriented edge e = xy in ⃗D, K := Ke is a desired biclique that is a balanced vertex
separator. Hence we assume that every marked edge is oriented in ⃗D. Since every bag of
⃗D can have at most one marked edge oriented outward, there exists a bag B such that all
incident marked edges are oriented toward B in ⃗D.
Consider the case when B is a leaf bag, e = xy is the unique marked edge incident with
B oriented from x to y, and y ∈V (B). If B is a complete bag or a star bag in which y is
the center, clearly all unmarked vertices of B belong to Ry(e), and thus Uy(e)\Ry(e) = ∅,
contradicting the orientation of e. If B is a star bag in which y is a leaf, the (unmarked)
center of B belongs to Ry(e). Observe that each unmarked leaf vertex of B forms a trivial
connected component of G[Uy(e) \ Ry(e)], contradicting the orientation of e.
Hence B is incident with at least two marked edges, say ei = xiyi for i = 1, 2, . . ., where
yi ∈V (B) for every i. Let UB be the set of unmarked vertices in B. We argue that B is
a star bag with its center unmarked.
(a) B is a complete bag: Observe that for every i, Ryi(ei) = S
j̸=i Rxj(ej) ∪UB. This
means Kei = Rxi(ei) ∪Ryi(ei) = S
j Rxj(ej) ∪B, that is, Kei is the same for every i.
Moreover, we have UB ⊆Kei. This means that each connected component of G −Kei of
size at most 1
2n, contradicting the orientations.
(b) B is a star bag with its center marked: Notice that the center of B is one of yi’s, say
y1. The orientation of e1 implies that G[Uy1(e1) \ Ry1(e1)] has a connected component C
containing more than 1
2n vertices. On the other hand, all vertices of UB and Rxi(ei) for
i ̸= 1 have an odd-length path in D −e1 to y1 alternating in marked and unmarked edges,
implying that UB ∪S
i̸=1 Rxi(ei) ⊆Ry1(e1). Therefore, C is contained in a connected
component of G[Uxj(ej) \ Rxj(ej)] for some j ̸= 1. This contradicts the orientation of ej.
Hence, B is a star bag with its center unmarked. Let v be the center of B and observe
that for every i, v is the only vertex in Byi(ei). Observe that K := {v} ∪S
i Rxi(ei) is a
biclique with the desired property. This completes the proof.

The following result is from [14].
Theorem 3.8 (Feige, Hajiaghayi, and Lee [14]). There is an O(√log opt)-approximation
algorithm for ﬁnding a balanced vertex separator.
Lemma 3.9. Let (G, k) be an instance to DH Vertex Deletion such that G is con-
nected and contains no small DH obstructions. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which
ﬁnds a balanced vertex separator K ⊎X such that
- K is a biclique or an empty set,
- and |X| = O(k√log k)
whenever (G, k) is a Yes-intance.
Proof. We perform the following algorithm. Let K be a maximal biclique of G or an
empty set. If every connected component of G −K contains at most 2
3n vertices, we take
X := ∅. Otherwise, we apply Theorem 3.8 to a (unique) largest connected component
C of G −K to ﬁnd a balanced vertex separator X of C of size O(opt√log opt). In both
cases, if X is of size at most O(k√log k), then K ⊎X is clearly a desired balanced vertex
separator.
If no balanced vertex separator of size at most O(k√log k) is found while
iterating over all maximal bicliques of G and an empty set as K, then we report that
there is no DH-modulator of size at most k. This algorithm runs in polynomial time since
a balanced vertex separator X of a connected component C can be found in polynomial
time by Theorem 3.8, and Lemma 3.6 provides an eﬃcient way to iterate over all maximal
bicliques.
To see the correctness, suppose that (G, k) is a Yes-instance and let X0 be an optimal
DH-modulator. If G−X0 forms an independent set, then X0 is a balanced vertex separator
of G −K, where K := ∅. Therefore, the approximation algorithm of Theorem 3.8 will
indeed ﬁnd O(k√log k)-size balanced vertex separator when the above algorithm considers
K = ∅.
Suppose this is not the case, and let C be a largest connected component of G −X0.
By Lemma 3.7, there is a balanced vertex separator K0 of C which is a biclique. Let K be
a maximal biclique in G with K0 ⊆K. Since each connected component of G −X0 −K0,
and thus of G−X0 −K, contains at most 2
3|C| ≤2
3n vertices, X0 ∪K is a balanced vertex
separator of G. Let C′ be any largest connected component of G−K. If C′ contains at most
2
3n vertices, then the above algorithm will set X := ∅. If not, observe that (X0 \ K) ∩C′
is a balanced vertex separator of C′ whose size is at most k. Hence, the above algorithm
applies the approximation algorithm of Theorem 3.8 to C′, and ﬁnds O(k√log k)-size
balanced vertex separator X′ of C′. Notice that each connected component of G−K −X′
has size at most max{1
3n, 2
3|C′|} ≤2
3n. This completes the proof.
□
For an instance (G, k) such that G does not contain any small DH obstructions, let
K1 ⊎X1 be a balanced vertex separator obtained by applying Lemma 3.9 to a connected
component of G that is not distance-hereditary. Notice that K1 ⊎X1 is not necessarily a
DH-modulator and there may be a connected component of G −(K1 ⊎X1) which is not
distance-hereditary. At i-th recursive step, we apply Lemma 3.9 to a connected component
Gi of G −S
j<i(Kj ⊎Xj) which is not distance-hereditary and obtain a balanced vertex
separator Ki⊎Xi of Gi. If the algorithm of Lemma 3.9 reports that (Gi, k) is a No-instance
for some i, then indeed (G, k) is a No-instance. Otherwise, we obtain a decomposition
V (G) = D ⊎Kℓ⊎· · · K1 ⊎Xℓ⊎· · · X1,

12
EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
where G[D] is distance-hereditary, each Ki is a biclique or an empty set, and |Xi| =
O(k√log k).
The recursive applications of Lemma 3.9 can be represented as a collection of branching
trees T , where each internal node corresponds to the initial connected component (that
are not distance-hereditary) to Lemma 3.9 and its children correspond to the connected
components obtained after removing a balanced separator. Suppose that (G, k) is a Yes-
instance and let S be a size-k modulator of G. Observe that each connected component
corresponding to an internal node of T contains at least one vertex of S.
Since the
maximum length of a root-to-leaf path in T is O(log n), any vertex of G (and thus,
S) appears in at most O(log n) connected components represented as the nodes of T .
It follows that the number of internal nodes of T is at most O(k log n), and thus ℓ=
O(k log n). This implies S
i≤ℓXi has at most O(k2√log k log n) vertices. We add them to
a DH-modulator S under construction and remove from G.
We summarize the result of this subsection.
Proposition 3.10. Let (G, k) be an instance to DH Vertex Deletion such that G
contains no small DH obstructions. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given
such (G, k), either computes a decomposition
V (G) = D ⊎Kℓ⊎· · · K1 ⊎X
such that G[D] is distance-hereditary, each Ki is a biclique, |X| = O(k2√log k log n) and
ℓ= O(k log n), or correctly reports that (G, k) is a No-instance.
3.3. Handling a controlled instance. A graph G is called a controlled graph with a
partition (D, K) if G contains no small DH obstructions and V (G) is partitioned into
D ⊎K such that G[D] is distance-hereditary and K is a biclique. We ﬁx such a partition
D ⊎K for a given controlled instance under consideration. Also we ﬁx a bipartition A⊎B
for the given biclique K such that ab ∈E(G) for every a ∈A and b ∈B. In this part, it
is important that both A and B are non-empty by the deﬁnition of a biclique.
The next lemma is useful.
Lemma 3.11. Let G be a controlled graph with a partition (D, K). For an induced cycle
H of length at least 7, let ℓbe the number of connected components in G[V (H)∩K]. Then
the followings hold.
(a) If ℓ= 1, then both G[V (H) ∩K] and H −K are paths, and |V (H) ∩K| ≤3.
(b) If ℓ≥2, there exists a subpath P of H such that P is a K-path, and the length of
P is at least 3.
Proof. If ℓ= 1, clearly both G[V (H) ∩K] and H −K are (induced) paths. Suppose
|V (H) ∩K| ≥4, and note that V (H) ∩K are contained in either A or B, say A. Then
G[(V (H) ∩K) ∪{b}] induces a gem for any b ∈B since G[V (H) ∩K] is an induced
path. This contradicts that G does not contain any small DH obstructions. It follows
|V (H) ∩K| ≤3.
Suppose ℓ≥2. There exist two K-paths on H, say P1 and P2, each containing at least
one internal vertex and occuring on H consecutively. (Recall that an S-path is a path
whose end vertices are in S and all of whose internal vertices lie outside S.) We note that
the end vertices of both P1 and P2 are contained in either A or B, say A; otherwise H
contains a chord. To prove (b), it suﬃces to show that one of P1 and P2 is of length at least
three. Obviously, we have |V (Pi)| ≥3 for i = 1, 2. Suppose that |V (P1)| = |V (P2)| = 3.

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
13
Let Q be a component of G[V (H) ∩K] that intersects with both P1 and P2 (possibly Q
consists of a single vertex). Pick an arbitrary vertex b ∈B; such b exists for B ̸= ∅. If
|V (Q)| = 1, observe that G[V (P1) ∪V (P2) ∪{b}] induces a gem, a house or a domino, a
contradiction. If |V (Q)| ≥2, then G[V (P1) ∪V (Q) ∪{b}] contains a gem or a house, a
contradiction. This establishes (b).

Lemma 3.12. Let G be a controlled graph with a partition (D, K). If x∗is a fractional
solution to DH Vertex Deletion for G such that x∗

x′ deﬁned as
x′
v =

if v ∈D
is also a feasible fractional solution.
Proof. Consider an arbitrary induced cycle H of length at least 7. We only need to verify
that x′(H) ≥1. There are two possibilities.
Suppose G[V (H) ∩K] contains exactly one connected component. By Lemma 3.11, we
have |V (H) ∩K| ≤3. By assumption, we have P
v∈V (H)∩K x∗
v < 3 · 1

If G[V (H)∩K] contains at least two connected components, by Lemma 3.11, H contains
a K-path P of length at least 3 as a subpath. Recall that V (H) ∩K are contained in
either A or B, say A. Hence, for any b ∈B, G[{b} ∪V (P)] contains an induced cycle H′
of length at least 7 by Lemma 2.2. Note that G[V (H′) ∩K] has exactly one connected
component and thus x′(H′) ≥1. Since x′

An instance of Vertex Multicut consists of an undirected graph G and a set T of
(unordered) vertex pairs of G. The goal is to ﬁnd a minimum-size set X ⊆V (G) that
hits every path from s to t for every (s, t) ∈T . Notice that we are allowed to delete a
terminal. An LP formulation of (G, T ) of Vertex Multicut is the same as the above
LP of DH Vertex Deletion, except that we replace the constraints on induced cycles
of length at least 7 by
x(P) ≥1
for every (s, t)-path P with (s, t) ∈T . The following result from [18] is originally stated
for Directed Multicut, where we want to ﬁnd a minimum set of arcs to hit all directed
(s, t)-path for every (ordered) terminal pairs. Using standard reductions, one can reduce
the undirected version of Vertex Multicut to Directed Vertex Multicut, which
again can be reduced to Directed Multicut. Moreover, these reductions preserve the
objective values of both the integral solutions and feasible fractional solutions.

Theorem 3.13 (Gupta [18]). Let x′ be a feasible fractional solution to a Vertex Mul-
ticut instance (G, T ). There exists a constant c such that, in polynomial time, one can
ﬁnd an integral solution to Vertex Multicut of size at most c · |x′|2.
Lemma 3.14. Let G be a controlled graph with a partition (D, K) and let x′ be a feasible
fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion such that x′
v < 1
10 for all v ∈D and x′
v = 0
for all v ∈K. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given such (G, k) and x′,
returns a DH-modulator X of size O(|x′|2).
Proof. We construct an instance (G[D], T ) of Vertex Multicut with terminal pairs
T := {(s, t) ⊆D × D : distG[D],x′(s, t) ≥1}, where distG[D],x′(s, t) is the minimum x′(P)
over all (s, t)-paths P.
Notice that for every terminal pair (s, t) ∈T , and for every
(s, t)-path P in G[D], we have
x′(P) ≥distG[D],x′(s, t) ≥1,
meaning that x′ is a feasible fractional solution to Vertex Multicut for the instance
(G[D], T ). By Theorem 3.13, we can obtain a vertex set X ⊆D of size O(|x′|2) such that
G[D \ X] contains no (s, t)-path for every terminal pair (s, t) ∈T in polynomial time.
It is suﬃcient to show that G −X is distance-hereditary. For the sake of contradiction,
suppose G−X contains an induced cycle H of length at least 7, and we speciﬁcally choose
H so as to minimize
the number of connected components in G[V (H) ∩K]
Claim 1. G[V (H) ∩K] has exactly one connected component and |V (H) ∩K| ≤3.
Proof of the Claim: Suppose G[V (H) ∩K] has at least two connected components.
Observe that V (H) ∩K is entirely contained either in A or B, say A. By Lemma 3.11,
there exists a subpath P of H that is a K-path and having length at least 3. Choose any
vertex b ∈B and observe that G[V (P)∪{b}] contains a DH obstruction H′ by Lemma 2.2.
Especially, H′ must be an induced cycle of length at least 7 since G does not contain any
small DH obstructions. For B ∩X = ∅, H′ is an induced cycle in G −X having strictly
less connected components in G[V (H′) ∩K], contradicting the choice of H. This proves
the ﬁrst part of the statement. The second part follows from Lemma 3.11.
♦
By Claim 1, H −K is an induced path P contained in a connected component of G[D].
Let s and t be the end vertices of P and notice that (s, t) /∈T since P contains no vertex
of X. Hence, G[D] contains an induced (s, t)-path W such that x′(W) < 1. Since x′ is
a feasible fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion, we have x′(P) ≥x′(H) ≥1.
Therefore, P contains at least 11 vertices since x′
v <
1
10 for every v ∈D and x′
v = 0 for
every v ∈K. Since G[D] is distance-hereditary and W is induced, we have |V (W)| =
|V (P)| ≥11. Let w1(= s), w1, . . . , wp(= t) be the vertices of W in the order of their
occurrence on W where p ≥11.
Now we argue that G[V (W) ∪(V (H) ∩K)] contains a DH obstruction.
Claim 2. G[V (W) ∪(V (H) ∩K)] contains an induced cycle of length at least 7.
Proof of the Claim: If |V (H) ∩K| = 1, this follows from Lemma 2.2. So, we may
assume that 2 ≤|V (H) ∩K| ≤3. Let v1, v2 be vertices of V (H) ∩K that are adjacent
with s = w1 and t = wp, respectively.

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
15
If v1 is adjacent with any of wj with j ≥4, then Lemma 2.2 applies and we have a DH
obstruction. Such an obstruction can only be an induced cycle of length at least 7 as we
assume that G does not contain a small DH obstruction. Hence, we may assume that v1
is not adjacent with any of w4, . . . , wp. By a symmetric argument, we may assume that v2
is not adjacent with any of w1, . . . , wp−3.
Let Q be a shortest path between v1 and v2 such that the set of internal vertices of
Q is non-empty and contained {w1, . . . , wp}. Such Q exists since v1 and v2 are adjacent
with w1 and wp, respectively. By the assumption that v1 (respectively, v2) is not adjacent
with wj for 4 ≤j ≤p (respectively, 1 ≤j ≤p −3), the length of Q clearly exceeds
6. If v1 and v2 are the only vertices of V (H) ∩K, then v1v2 ∈E(G) and observe that
G[{v1, v2} ∪V (Q)] forms an induced cycle of length at least 7. If there is another vertex
in V (H) ∩K, observe that the remaining vertex, say v3, is adjacent to v1 and v2. By
Lemma 2.2, there exists a DH obstruction in G[{v1, v2, v3} ∪V (Q)], which can only be an
induced cycle of length at least 7.
♦
Let ˜H be such an induced cycle of length at least 7 as stated in Claim 2. That V ( ˜H) ⊆
V (W) ∪(V (H) ∩K) and x′(V (H) ∩K) = 0 implies x′( ˜H) ≤x′(W) < 1. This contradicts
the assumption that x′ is a feasible fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion. This
concludes the proof that G −X is distance-hereditary.
□
One can easily obtain the main result of this subsection.
Proposition 3.15. Let G be a controlled graph with a partition (D, K) and x∗be a feasible
fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion such that x∗
v <

20 for every v ∈V (G).
There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given such G and x∗, ﬁnds a DH-modulator
X of size at most O(|x∗|2).
Proof. By Lemma 3.12, we can obtain a feasible fractional solution x′ to DH Vertex
Deletion such that x′
v = 0 for every v ∈K, x′
v <
1
10 for every v ∈D and |x′| ≤2|x∗|.
Such x′ meets the condition of Lemma 3.14, and we can obtain a DH-modulator X of G
such that |X| = O(|x′|2) = O(|x∗|2) in polynomial time.
□
3.4. Proof of Theorem 3.1. We ﬁrst present the proof of Proposition 3.2. Let (G, k)
be an instance of DH Vertex Deletion such that G does not contain any small DH
obstructions. Let x∗be an optimal fractional solution to DH Vertex Deletion for
G. We may assume that |x∗| ≤k, otherwise we immediately report that (G, k) is a No-
instance. Let ˜X be the set of all vertices v such that x∗
v ≥
1
20. Observe that | ˜X| ≤20k
since otherwise, |x∗| ≥
1
20 · | ˜X| > k, a contradiction. Also x∗restricted to V (G) \ ˜X is a
fractional feasible solution to DH Vertex Deletion for G −˜X such that x∗
v <
1
20 for
every v.
We compute a decomposition V (G −˜X) = D ⊎Sℓ
i=1 Ki ⊎X as in Proposition 3.10, or
correctly report (G, k) as a No-instance. Recall that ℓ= O(k log n) and |X| = O(k2√log k·
log n). Note that V (G −( ˜X ∪X)) = D ⊎Sℓ
i=1 Ki. From i = 1 up to ℓ, we want to obtain
a DH-modulator Si of Gi, where G1 := G[D ∪K1] and for i = 2, . . . , ℓ, Gi is the subgraph
of G induced by (V (Gi−1) \ Si−1) ∪Ki. Notice that for every i = 1, . . . , ℓ−1, if Gi −Si is
distance-hereditary, then Gi+1 is a controlled graph with a partition (V (Gi)\Si, Ki+1). For
i = 1, clearly G1 is a controlled graph. Hence, we can inductively apply the algorithm of
Proposition 3.15 and obtain a DH-modulator Si of size at most O(|x∗|2) of Gi. Especially,

EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
Gℓ−Sℓis distance-hereditary, implying that the set deﬁned as
S := ˜X ∪X ∪
ℓ[
i=1
Si
is a DH-modulator of G. From |x∗| ≤k, we have |Si| = O(k2). It follows that |S| =
O(k3 · log n).
Proposition 3.2 immediately yields the proof of Theorem 3.1, which we summarize
below.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let P be a maximal collection of vertex-disjoint copies of small DH
obstructions in G. If P contains at least k + 1 copies, then clearly (G, k) is a No-instance
to DH Vertex Deletion. Otherwise, let V (P) be the vertex set of the copies in P and
notice that |V (P)| ≤6k. Notice that G −V (P) contains no small DH obstruction, and
thus we can apply the algorithm A of Propositioin 3.2. If A reports that (G −V (P), k)
is a No-instance, then clearly (G, k) is a No-instance as well. Otherwise, let S be a DH-
modulator of G −V (P) whose size is O(k3 · log n). It remains to observe that S ∪V (P)
is a DH-modulator of G whose size is O(k3 · log n).
□
4. Good Modulator
In the previous section, we presented a polynomial-time algorithm, given an instance
(G, k) which outputs a DH-modulator of size O(k3 · log n) whenever (G, k) is a Yes-
instance. In this section, we shall see how to obtain a good DH-modulator. In order
to obtain a good DH-modulator, we need to ﬁnd a small-sized hitting set that intersects
every DH obstruction having exactly one vertex in S. This task is easy for a small DH
obstruction, but not straightforward for the induced cycles of length at least 5. We ﬁrst
present a tool to eﬃciently handle the latter case.
Proposition 4.1. Let G be a graph without any small DH obstruction, v be a vertex of
G such that G −v is distance-hereditary and k be a positive integer. In polynomial time,
one can either
(1) ﬁnd a set X ⊆V (G) \ {v} of size at most O(k2) such that G −X contains no
induced cycle of length at least 5 traversing v, or
(2) correctly reports that any DH-modulator of size at most k must contain v.
Proof. Consider an instance (G −v, T ) of Vertex Multicut where
T := {(s, t) : s, t ∈NG(v), distG−v(s, t) ≥3}.
First, we claim that X ⊆V (G) \ {v} hits all induced cycles of G of length at least
5 if and only if X is a vertex multicut for (G −v, T ). Suppose X is a vertex multicut
for (G −v, T ) and H is an induced cycle of length at least 5 in G −X. Since G −v is
distance-hereditary, v is a vertex of H and H −v is a path of length at least 3 between,
say, s and t. This means distG−v(s, t) ≥3 because G −v is distance-hereditary and thus
(s, t) ∈T , contradicting the assumption that X hits all paths between every terminal pair
in T . Conversely, suppose X ⊆V (G) \ {v} hits all induced cycles of length at least 5 and
there is an (s, t)-path P in (G −v) −X for some (s, t) ∈T . Note that P is of length
at least 3 and thus by Lemma 2.2, G[{v} ∪V (P)] contains a DH obstruction H. By the
assumption that G does not contain a small DH obstruction, H is an induced cycle of
length at least 7 in G −X, a contradiction.

Let x∗be an optimal fractional solution to Vertex Multicut, which can be eﬃciently
found using the ellipsoid method and an algorithm for the (weighted) shortest path prob-
lem as a separation oracle. If |x∗| ≤k, then we can construct a multicut X ⊆V (G) \ {v}
of size O(|x∗|2) = O(k2) using the approximation algorithm of Theorem 3.13. By the
previous claim, we know that X hits all induced cycles of G of length at least 5 (which
must traverse v). If |x∗| > k, then any integral solution for (G −v, T ) is larger than k.
By the previous claim, any set X ⊆V (G) \ {v} hitting all induced cycles of G of length
at least 5 must be larger than k. It follows that any DH-modulator of size at most k must
contain v, completing the proof.
□
The following theorem states that a good DH-modulator of size O(k5 · log n) can be
constructed eﬃciently.
Theorem 4.2. There is a polynomial-time algorithm which, given a graph G and a positive
integer k, either
(1) returns an equivalent instance (G′, k′) with a good DH-modulator S′ ⊆V (G′) of
size O(k5 · log n), or
(2) correctly reports that (G, k) is a No-instance to Distance-hereditary Vertex
Deletion.
Proof. We ﬁrst apply the algorithm of Theorem 3.1. If this algorithm reports that (G, k)
is a No-instance, then we are done.
Hence, we assume that a DH-modulator S of G
containing at most O(k3 · log n) vertices is returned. Let U := ∅, and for each v ∈S, let
Hv := G[(V (G) \ S) ∪{v}].
For each v ∈S, we do the following. First, ﬁnd either k + 1 small DH obstructions in
Hv whose pairwise intersection is v, or a vertex set Tv of V (G) \ S such that |Tv| ≤5k
and Hv −Tv has no small DH obstructions. It can be done in polynomial time by going
through all 5-size subsets of V (G) \ S. In the former case, we add v to U. Otherwise, we
obtain a vertex set Tv in the second statement.
Assume we obtained the vertex set Tv. Since Hv −Tv has no small DH obstructions,
every DH obstruction in Hv is an induced cycle of length at least 7. We apply the algorithm
of Proposition 4.1 to Hv−Tv and v, and it returns either a vertex set Xv ⊆V (Hv−Tv)\{v}
of size O(k2) such that Hv −(Tv ∪Xv) has no DH obstructions, or correctly reports that
any DH-modulator of size at most k must contain v. In the latter case, we add v to U.
Otherwise, we obtain such a vertex set Xv. This ﬁnishes the algorithm.
We claim that (G−U, k −|U|) is an instance equivalent to (G, k) and S ∪(S
v∈S\U(Tv ∪
Xv)) is a good DH-modulator for G −U. It is easy to see that if (G −U, k −|U|) a Yes-
instance, then (G, k) is a Yes-instance. Suppose G has a vertex set T such that |T| ≤k
and G −T is distance-hereditary. Let v ∈U. Since v ∈U, by the algorithm as above,
either there are k + 1 pairwise small DH obstructions in Hv whose pairwise intersection
is v, or any DH-modulator of size at most k must contain v. Thus, T contains v, and it
implies that U ⊆T. Therefore, T \ U is a solution of (G −U, k −|U|).
Let S′ := S ∪(S
v∈S\U(Tv ∪Xv)). It remains to see that S′ is a good DH-modulator
for G −U. Clearly S′ is a DH-modulator. For contradiction, suppose that F is a DH
obstruction of G−U and that V (F)∩S′ = {w}. Since S is a DH-modulator of G, w cannot
be a vertex of S
v∈S\U(Tv ∪Xv), and thus we have w ∈S and F is an induced subgraph of
Hw −(Tw ∪Xw). However, Hw −(Tw ∪Xw) has no DH obstruction, contradiction. This
completes the proof.

We remark that given a graph G and a good DH-modulator removing a vertex v in
V (G) \ S does not create a new DH obstruction. Hence, S remains a good DH-modulator
in the graph G −v.
5. Twin Reduction Rule
In a distance-hereditary graph, there may be a large set of pairwise twins. We introduce
a reduction rule that bounds the size of a set of pairwise twins in G−S by O(k2|S|3), where
S is a DH-modulator. In the FPT algorithm obtained by Eiben, Ganian, and Kwon [10],
there is a similar rule which reduces the size of a twin set outside of a DH-modulator,
however, under the assumption that the given instance has no small DH obstructions. For
our kernelization algorithm, we cannot assume that the given instance has no small DH
obstructions. Therefore, we need to analyze more carefully.
The underlying observation is that it suﬃces to keep up to k + 1 vertices that are
pairwise twins with respect to each subset of S of small size. For a subset S′ ⊆S, two
vertices u and v in V (G) \ S are S′-twins if u and v have the same neighbors in S′. It
is not diﬃcult to get an upper bound O(k|S|5), by considering all subsets S′ of S of size
min{|S|, 5} and marking up to k + 1 S′-twins. To get a better bound, we proceed as
follows.
Reduction Rule 1. Let W be a set of pairwise twins in G −S, and let m := min{|S|, 3}.
(1) Over all subsets S′ ⊆S of size m, we mark up to k + 1 pairwise S′-twins in W that
are unmarked yet.
(2) When |S| ≥4, over all subsets S′ ⊆S of size 4, if there is an unmarked vertex v of
W such that G[S′ ∪{v}] is isomorphic to the house or the gem, then we mark up to
k + 1 previously unmarked vertices in W including v that are pairwise S′-twins.
(3) If there is an unmarked vertex v of W after ﬁnishing the marking procedure, we remove
v from G.
Lemma 5.1. Reduction Rule 1 is safe
Proof. We recall that m := min{|S|, 3}. Let W be a set of pairwise twins in G −S, and
suppose there is an unmarked vertex in W. We show that (G, k) is a Yes-instance if and
only if (G −v, k) is a Yes-instance. The forward direction is clear. Suppose that G −v
has a vertex set T with |T| ≤k such that (G −v) −T is distance-hereditary. We claim
that G −T is also distance-hereditary. For contradiction, suppose G −T contains a DH
obstruction F. Clearly, v ∈V (F).
In case when F −v is an induced path, let w, z be the end vertices of the path, and
choose a set S′ ⊆S of size m containing {w, z} ∩S (possibly, an empty set).
Since
v is an unmarked vertex in Reduction Rule 1, there are v1, . . . , vk+1 ∈W \ {v} where
v1, . . . , vk+1, v are pairwise S′-twins. Note that V (F) ∩{v1, . . . , vk+1} = ∅since no other
vertex in F is adjacent to both w and z. Thus, there exists v′ ∈{v1, . . . , vk+1} \ T such
that G[V (F) \ {v} ∪{v′}] is a DH obstruction in (G −v) −T, a contradiction. We may
assume F −v is not an induced path, and in particular F is not an induced cycle.
Suppose |V (F) ∩S| ≤3. Then there exists a set S′ ⊆S of size m such that V (F) ∩
S ⊆S′. Since v remains unmarked in the application of Reduction Rule 1, there are
v1, . . . , vk+1 ∈W \ {v} where v1, . . . , vk+1, v are pairwise S′-twins. Note that V (F) ∩
{v1, . . . , vk+1} = ∅since F contains no twins. Thus, there exists v′ ∈{v1, . . . , vk+1} \ T
such that G[V (F) \ {v} ∪{v′}] is a DH obstruction in (G −v) −T, a contradiction.

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
19
Now we assume |V (F) ∩S| ≥4. There are two possibilities.
Case 1. F is isomorphic to either the house or the gem.
Since |V (F) ∩S| ≥4, we have V (F) \ {v} ⊆S. By Step (2) of Reduction Rule 1, there
are v1, . . . , vk+1 ∈W \ {v} where v1, . . . , vk+1, v are pairwise (V (F) ∩S)-twins. Thus,
there exists v′ ∈{v1, . . . , vk+1} \ T such that G[V (F) \ {v} ∪{v′}] is a DH obstruction in
(G −v) −T, contradiction.
Case 2. F is isomorphic to the domino.
Since F −v is not an induced path, v is a vertex of degree 2 in F. Let v′, w be the
neighbors of v having degree 2 and degree 3 in F, respectively. Let w′ be the vertex of
degree 3 in F other than w. Let z be the vertex in NF (w)\{v, w′} and let z′ be the vertex
in NF (w′) \ {v′, w}.
Now, we take a subset S′ of S of size 3 containing S ∩{v′, w, z′} (possibly, an empty
set). Since v is an unmarked vertex in Reduction Rule 1, there are v1, . . . , vk+1 ∈W \ {v}
where v1, . . . , vk+1, v are pairwise S′-twins. Note that V (F) ∩{v1, . . . , vk+1} = ∅since no
other vertex in F is adjacent to both v′, w and not adjacent to z′. Thus, there exists a
vertex v′′ ∈{v1, . . . , vk+1} \ T.
If v′′ is adjacent to z, then v′w′wz is an induced path of length 3 and v′′ is adjacent to its
end vertices. It follows that G[{v′′, v′, w′, w, z}] contains a DH obstruction by Lemma 2.2,
a contradiction to the assumption that (G−v)−T is distance-hereditary. Suppose that v′′
is not adjacent to z. If v′′ is adjacent to w′, then G[{v′′, w, w′, z, z′}] is isomorphic to the
house, and otherwise, G[{v′′, v′, w, w′, z, z′}] is isomorphic to the domino. This contradicts
the assumption that (G −v) −T is distance-hereditary.
Therefore, G −T is distance-hereditary, which completes the proof.
□
We can apply Reduction Rule 1 exhaustively in polynomial time by considering all twin
sets of G −S, and for each twin set going through all subsets S′ of S of size min(|S|, 4).
We observe that the size of a twin set W after applying Reduction Rule 1 is bounded by
a polynomial function in k and |S|.
Lemma 5.2. Let S be a DH-modulator of G, and W be a set of pairwise twins in G −S.
If (G, k) is irreducible with respect to Reduction Rule 1, then we have |W| = O(k2|S|3) or
(G, k) is a No-instance.
Proof. Suppose that (G, k) is a Yes-instance. It suﬃces to prove that |W| satisﬁes the
claimed bound. First assume that |S| ≥4. There are at most
 |S|


diﬀerent choices of S′
in Step (1), and for each S′ we mark up to 23(k + 1) vertices of W.
Consider an auxiliary hypergraph H on the vertex set S. A size-4 subset S′ of S forms a
hyperedge of H if and only if S′ is used to mark some vertex of W in Step (2). Observe that
if there exist k + 1 vertex-disjoint hyperedges of H, then there are k + 1 vertex-disjoint
copies of a house or a gem. As we assume that (G, k) is a Yes-instance, a maximum
packing of hyperedges has size at most k. Let C be the vertices of S that are contained in
a maximal packing of hyperedges and notice that |C| ≤4k. Since any hyperedge e of H
intersects with C, the following count on the maximum number of hyperedges is derived:

Assume that |S| ≤3. Then we mark up to 2|S|(k +1) ≤8(k +1) vertices of W. Thus, if
|W| > 8(k +1), then the set W can be reduced further by removing a vertex. The claimed
bound follows.
□
6. Bounding the number of non-trivial connected components of G −S
We provide a reduction rule that that bounds the number of connected components of
G −S each having at least 2 vertices, when S is a good DH-modulator.
Let (G, k) be an instance, and let S be a good DH-modulator. For each pair of v ∈S
and a connected component C of G −S, let N(v, C) := NG(v) ∩V (C). Note that for a
non-trivial connected component C of G −S, (V (C), V (G) \ V (C)) is not a split if and
only if there exist v, w ∈S such that N(v, C) ̸= ∅, N(w, C) ̸= ∅and N(v, C) ̸= N(w, C).
We say that a pair (v, w) of vertices in S is a witnessing pair for a connected component
C of G −S if N(v, C) ̸= ∅, N(w, C) ̸= ∅and N(v, C) ̸= N(w, C).
The following lemma is essential.
Lemma 6.1. Let (G, k) be an instance and S be a good DH-modulator. If C1, C2 are two
connected components of G −S and v, w ∈S such that (v, w) is a witnessing pair for both
C1 and C2, then G[{v, w} ∪V (C1) ∪V (C2)] contains a DH obstruction.
Proof. Since N(v, C1) ̸= ∅, N(w, C1) ̸= ∅, and N(v, C1) ̸= N(w, C1), there exists a vertex
z ∈V (C1) where z is adjacent to only one of v and w. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that z is adjacent to v. We choose a neighbor z′ of v in C2. Clearly, there is
a path from z to z′ in G[{v, w} ∪V (C1) ∪V (C2)] −v because w has a neighbor on each
of C1 and C2. Let P be a shortest path from z to z′ in G[{v, w} ∪V (C1) ∪V (C2)] −v.
Note that P has length at least 3, as w and z are not adjacent. Thus, by Lemma 2.2,
G[{v, w} ∪V (C1) ∪V (C2)] contains a DH obstruction.
□
Lemma 6.1 observes that if a pair of vertices in S witnesses at least k + 2 non-trivial
connected components in G −S, at least one of the pair must be contained in any size-
k DH-modulator. Furthermore, keeping exactly k + 2 non-trivial connected components
would suﬃce to impose this restriction. This suggests the following reduction rule.
Reduction Rule 2. For each pair of vertices v and w in S, we mark up to k + 2 non-trivial
(previously unmarked) connected components C of G −S such that (v, w) is a witnessing
pair for C. If there is an unmarked non-trivial connected component C after the marking
procedure, then we remove all edges in C.
The following is useful to see the safeness of our reduction rule.
Lemma 6.2. Let G be a graph, and let (A, B) be a split of G.
Then for every DH
obstruction H of G, either |V (H) ∩A| ≤1 or |V (H) ∩B| ≤1.
Proof. Suppose for contradiction that |V (H) ∩A| ≥2 and |V (H) ∩B| ≥2. Since H is
connected, (V (H) ∩A, V (H) ∩B) is a split of H. This is contradiction because every DH
obstruction does not have a split.
□

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
21
Lemma 6.3. Reduction Rule 2 is safe. Moreover, S remains a good DH-modulator after
applying the reduction rule.
Proof. Suppose there is an unmarked non-trivial connected component C of G −S after
the marking procedure. Let G′ be the graph obtained by removing all edges in C. We
claim that (G, k) is a Yes-instance if and only if (G′, k) is a Yes-instance.
We ﬁrst prove the converse direction. Suppose T is a vertex set of G′ such that |T| ≤k
and G′ −T is distance-hereditary.
We claim that (V (C) \ T, V (G) \ V (C) \ T) is a
split of G −T. Suppose (V (C) \ T, V (G) \ V (C) \ T) is not a split of G −T. Thus,
there are v, w ∈S \ T, where NG(v) ∩(V (C) \ T) ̸= ∅, NG(w) ∩(V (C) \ T) ̸= ∅, and
NG(v) ∩(V (C) \ T) ̸= NG(w) ∩(V (C) \ T). It further implies that (v, w) is a witnessing
pair for C in G. Since C is unmarked, there are k + 2 non-trivial connected components
C1, . . . , Ck+2 of G −S other than C where (v, w) is a witness pair for each Ci in G.
From |T| ≤k, there are two components Ci, Cj ∈{C1, . . . , Ck+2} that do not contain a
vertex of T. By Lemma 6.1, the graph (G′ −T)[{v, w} ∪V (C1) ∪V (C2)] contains a DH
obstruction. It contradicts to the assumption that G′ −T has no DH obstructions. Thus,
(V (C) \ T, V (G) \ V (C) \ T) is a split of G −T as claimed.
Suppose for contradiction that G −T contains a DH obstruction H. (V (C) \ T, V (G) \
V (C) \ T) is a split of G −T, we have either |V (H) ∩V (C)| ≤1 or |V (H) \ V (C)| ≤1
by Lemma 6.2. As S is a good DH-modulator, the only possibility is |V (H) ∩V (C)| ≤1.
This means that H is also an induced subgraph of G′ −T, a contradiction. Therefore, T
is also a solution to (G, k).
For the forward direction, suppose that T is a vertex set of G such that |T| ≤k
and G −T is distance-hereditary. By a similar argument as above, one can show that
(V (C) \ T, V (G′) \ V (C) \ T) is a split in G′ −T. Hence, any DH obstruction H in G′ −T
contains at most one vertex of C, and thus H is also an induced subgraph of G−T, which
contradicts to the assumption that G −T is distance-hereditary. We conclude that (G′, k)
is a Yes-instance if (G, k) is a Yes-instance.
To see that S remains a good DH-modulator after applying the reduction rule, suppose
that S is not a good DH-modulator after the application of Reduction Rule 2. It is easy
to see that S is again a DH-modulator of G′.
Hence, we may assume there is a DH
osbtruction F in G′ such that |V (F) ∩S| = 1. Such F must contain at least two vertices
u, v such that uv ∈E(G) \ E(G′). Notice that the reduction rule ensures that such u, v
are adjacent only with the vertices of S. Due to the assumption |V (F) ∩S| = 1, u and v
are pendant vertices in F, which is not possible for a DH obstruction F. Therefore, S is
a good DH-modulator of G′. This completes the proof.
□
Now we analyze the bound on the number of non-trivial connected components in G−S
after applying Reduction Rule 2. It is not diﬃcult to see that there are at most (k+2)|S|2
non-trivial connected components in G −S after the reduction. We obtain the following
bound, which is better than a naive bound whenever |S| is a polynomial in k of degree at
least two.
Proposition 6.4. Let (G, k) be an instance and S be a good DH-modulator. If (G, k) is
irreducible with respect to Reduction Rule 2, then either the number of non-trivial connected
components is at most O(k2 · |S|) or it is a No-instance.
The basic idea is that if there is a collection of k + 1 pairwise disjoint pairs in S, each
witnessing at least two non-trivial connected components of G−S, there exist k+1 disjoint

22
EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
copies of DH obstructions due to Lemma 6.1. Therefore, after removing the vertices in
this matching structure, any pair of vertices in the remaining part of S must witness
at most one connected component. Then, we use Erd˝os-P´osa property for cycles and a
generalization of Lemma 6.1 to argue that the remaining part of S is sparse, in the sense
that the number of connected components witnessed by this part is linear in |S|.
Theorem 6.5 (Erd˝os and P´osa [11]). There exists a constant r such that, given an arbi-
trary graph G and a positive integer k, either ﬁnds k + 1 vertex-disjoint cycles or a vertex
set X ⊆V (G) with |X| ≤r · k log k hitting all cycles of G.
The following is a generalization of Lemma 6.1.
Lemma 6.6. Let (G, k) be an instance and S be a good DH-modulator. Suppose that
v1, v2, . . . , vm is a circular ordering of m(≥2) vertices in S and C be a set of non-trivial
connected components of G −S such that over all i, the pairs (vi, vi+1) witness mutu-
ally distinct components of C, where vm+1 = v1. Then G[{v1, v2, . . . , vm} ∪S
C∈C V (C)]
contains a DH obstruction.
Proof. We prove by induction on m. Let C1, . . . , Cm be mutually distinct components of
C witnessed by (vi, vi+1). Let H := G[{v1, v2, . . . , vm} ∪S
C∈C V (C)]. The statement is
equivalent to Lemma 6.1 when m = 2, hence we assume m ≥3.
We claim that for every i, the neighbors of Ci among {v1, . . . , vm} are exactly {vi, vi+1}
or there is a DH obstruction in H. Suppose that there exist i and vj /∈{vi, vi+1} such
that vj has a neighbor in Ci. If N(vj, Ci) = N(vi, Ci), then N(vj, Ci) ̸= N(vi+1, Ci),
and thus (vj, vi+1) is a witnessing pair for Ci. Observe that vi+1, vi+2, . . . , vj is a circular
ordering (possibly j = i + 2) meeting the condition of the statement, with Ci+1, . . . , Ci as
the connected components witnessed by the consecutive pairs (vi+1, vi+2), . . . , (vj, vi+1). If
N(vj, Ci) ̸= N(vi, Ci), the circular ordering vi, vj, . . . , vi−1, possibly with j = i −1, meets
the condition with Ci, Cj, . . . , Ci−1 witnessed by the pairs (vi, vj), (vj, vj+1), . . . , (vi−1, vi).
In both cases, we conclude that H contains a DH obstruction by induction hypothesis.
Therefore, we may assume that for every i, the neighbors of Ci among {v1, . . . , vm} are
exactly {vi, vi+1}. Since N(v1, C1) ̸= ∅, N(v2, C1) ̸= ∅, and N(v1, C1) ̸= N(v2, C1), there
exists a vertex z ∈V (C1) where z is adjacent to only one of v1 and v2. By symmetry, we
may assume that z is adjacent to v1. We choose a neighbor z′ of v1 in Cm. Note that
H −v1 is connected. Let P be a shortest path from z to z′ in H −v1. Since {v2, . . . , vm}
separates z and z′ in H −v1 and the only neighbor of C1 in {v2, . . . , vm} is v2 by the above
claim, the path P traverse v2. From the fact that z is not adjacent with v2, it follows that
P has length at least 3. By Lemma 2.2, G[V (P) ∪{v1}] contains a DH obstruction. This
completes the proof.
□
We are ready to prove Proposition 6.4
Proof of Proposition 6.4. If (G, k) is a No-instance, there is nothing to prove. We assume
that (G, k) is a Yes-instance.
Let us deﬁne an auxiliary multigraph F on the vertex set S such that for every pair
v, w ∈S, the multiplicity of the edge vw equals the number of non-trivial connected
components that are marked by the witness of (v, w) in Reduction Rule 2. Recall that
each non-trivial connected component of G −S is marked at most once, which implies
that the edge set of F can be bijectively mapped to the non-trivial connected components

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
23
of G −S (after removing unmarked components). Therefore, it suﬃces to obtain a bound
on the number of edges in F with the edge multiplicity taken into account.
Construct a maximal packing of 2-cycles in F and let S1 ⊆S be the vertices contained
in the packing. By Lemma 6.1, a packing of size k + 1 implies the existence of k + 1
vertex-disjoint DH obstructions. Therefore, |S1| ≤2k.
Again, due to the assumption that (G, k) is a Yes-instance, the subgraph F −S1 does
not have k + 1 vertex-disjoint cycles: otherwise, G contains k + 1 vertex-disjoint DH
obstructions by Lemma 6.6.
Theorem 6.5 implies that there exists a vertex set S2 ⊆
V (F) \ S1 hitting all cycles of F −S1 with |S2| ≤r · k log k for some constant r.
Now, the number of edges in F is at most
|S1| · |S|(k + 2) + |S2| · |S \ S1| + (|S \ S1 \ S2|)
= 2k(k + 2)|S| + r · k log k · |S| + |S| ≤(7 + r)k2 · |S|,
which establishes the claimed bound.
□
7. Bounding the size of non-trivial connected components of G −S
In this section, we introduce several reduction rules that reduce the number of bags in
the canonical split decomposition of a non-trivial connected component of G −S, where
S is a good DH-modulator of G. Together with Reduction Rule 1 which shrinks the twin
set in each bag, the result of this section bounds the number of vertices of each non-
trivial connected component of G −S. In particular, we will prove that if the canonical
split decomposition of a non-trivial connected component of G −S contains more than
3|S|(20k + 54) bags, then we can apply some reduction rule.
Let D be the canonical split decomposition of a connected component H of G −S.
Since S is a good DH-modulator, for each vertex v of S, G[V (H) ∪{v}] is distance-
hereditary. In particular, if G[V (H) ∪{v}] is connected, then we can extend D into a
canonical split decomposition of G[V (H) ∪{v}] using the result by Gioan and Paul [17].
By Theorem 2.6, in time O(|V (G)|) we can uniquely decide either a bag or a marked edge
of D that will accommodate v so as to extend the split decomposition D of H into the
split decomposition of G[V (H) ∪{v}]. See Theorem 2.6 for details on how the unique bag
(called the partially accessible bag) or marked edge is characterized. The bag or marked
edge that accommodations v shall be colored for all v ∈S, and also we apply a short-range
propagation rule on the colored parts. We shall apply reduction rules to shrink uncolored
parts.
Let f be the injective function from S ∩NG(V (H)) to the union of the set of all marked
edges and the set of all bags such that f(v) is the the partially accessible bag or the marked
edge indicated by Theorem 2.6. We can compute this function f in time O(|S| · |V (G)|).
A bag or a marked edge in D is S-aﬀected if it is f(v) for some v ∈S, and S-unaﬀected
otherwise.
We may assume that D consists of more than one bag. For two adjacent bags B1 and
B2, we denote by e(B1, B2) the marked edge linking B1 and B2.
7.1. Reduction Rules to bound the number of leaf bags. We ﬁrst provide simpler
rules.
Reduction Rule 3. If v is a vertex of degree at most 1 in G, then remove v.
The safeness of Reduction Rule 3 is clear.

Reduction Rule 4. Let B be a leaf bag of D and let B′ be its neighbor bag such that
• B, B′, and e(B, B′) are S-unaﬀected,
• D −V (B′) has exactly two connected components, and
• B′ is a star bag whose center is adjacent to B.
Then remove the unmarked vertices in B′.
Reduction Rule 4 is illustrated in Figure 4.
Lemma 7.1. Reduction Rule 4 is safe.
Proof. We claim that there is no DH obstruction containing an unmarked vertex in B′.
First observe that B is not a star bag whose leaf is adjacent to B′ because D is a canonical
split decomposition.
Furthermore, vertices in B are pairwise twins in G, as B is S-
unaﬀected. If G has a DH obstruction H containing an unmarked vertex of B′, then H
contains at least 2 vertices in B as B, B′, and e(B, B′) are S-unaﬀected. But this is
not possible since every DH obstruction does not contain twins. Therefore, we can safely
remove the vertices in B′.
□
Reduction Rule 5. Let A ⊆V (H) be a set of vertices that are pairwise twins in G. Flip
the adjacency relation among the vertices of A if the resulting graph has strictly smaller
number of bags in D.
The safety of Reduction Rule 5 is already observed in [10], which is an immediate
consequence of the fact that every DH obstruction contains at most one vertex among
pairwise twins.
Lemma 7.2. One can apply Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5 exhaustively in polynomial time.
Furthermore, S is a good DH-modulator in the resulting graph G′.
Proof. The statement trivially holds for Reduction Rules 3 and 4. Let A ⊆V (H) be a
set of vertices that are pairwise twins in G. Then A must be contained in a bag of D.
Notice that a twin set in G −S is a twin set in G if and only if it is either complete or
anti-complete to each vertex of S, which can be tested in polynomial time. Therefore, by
skimming through each bag and a twin set contained in it (and modifying the canonical
split decomposition accordingly), we can detect a set A to apply Reduction Rule 5 or
correctly decide that no such A exists. Each application of Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5
reduces either the number of vertices in G or the number of bags, and the statement
follows.
To see the second statement holds, we only need to check that S is a good DH-modulator
in G′ obtained by applying Reduction Rule 5 once. This is an immediate consequence of
the fact A is a twin set in G′ and no DH obstruction can contain two twin vertices.
□
Lemma 7.3. Let (G, k) be an instance reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5. If a
leaf bag B of D is S-unaﬀected, then

(i) either B is a complete bag or it is a star bag whose center is marked, and
(ii) the unique bag B′ adjacent with B is a star bag whose center is adjacent with B.
Proof. Suppose B is a star bag whose center is unmarked. Since B is S-unaﬀected, there
are no edges between S and the set of leaves of B. Thus, each leaf of B is a leaf of G,
contradicting that (G, k) is reduced under Reduction Rule 3. The ﬁrst statement follows.
To prove (ii), ﬁrst suppose B′ is a complete bag. Then B cannot be a complete bag since
there cannot be two complete bags adjacent in a canonical split decomposition. Hence
by (i), B is a star bag whose center is adjacent with B′. Since B is S-unaﬀected, each
vertex of S is either complete to the set of unmarked vertices of B, or anti-complete to it.
So, the set of unmarked vertices of B is a twin set of G and applying Reduction Rule 5
will recompose the marked edge e(B, B′), strictly reducing the number of bags.
This
contradicts that (G, k) is reduced under Reduction Rule 5.
Therefore, B′ is a star bag. First assume that a leaf of B′ is adjacent to B. In that
case, B cannot be a star bag whose center is adjacent to B′, because D is a canonical split
decomposition. Thus, B is a complete bag. Since B is S-unaﬀected, the set of unmarked
vertices of B is a twin set of G, and applying Reduction Rule 5 will lead to recomposing
the marked edge e(B, B′), strictly reducing the number of bags. Thus we conclude that
the center of B′ is adjacent to B.
□
Throughout the rest of the section, we assume that (G, k) is reduced under Reduction
Rules 3, 4, and 5. We call that a bag B is a branch bag if D −V (B) contains at least
3 connected components having at least two bags. We color the bags of D with red and
blue in the following way.
(1) If a bag B is S-aﬀected or incident with an S-aﬀected edge, we color B with red.
(2) If a bag B is adjacent to an S-aﬀected leaf bag, we color B with red.
(3) If B is a branch bag, then we color B with red.
(4) All other bags are colored with blue.
Let R be the set of all red bags, and let Q be the set of all blue leaf bags B whose
unique neighbor bag is red. We prove the followings.
Lemma 7.4. For each bag B, there is at most one blue leaf bag adjacent to B.
Proof. Suppose for contradiction that there are a bag B and two blue leaf bags B1 and
B2 adjacent to B. Since each Bi is a blue leaf bag, Bi is S-unaﬀected. Therefore, by
Lemma 7.3, B is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bi for both i = 1, 2, which is
impossible.
□
Lemma 7.5. Let (G, k) be an instance reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5. For
any connected components D′ of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B), D′ is adjacent with exactly two red
bags in D.
Proof. Suppose that D′ is adjacent with exactly one red bag, say L, in D. Notice that D′
consists of at least two bags since otherwise, the single bag in D′ is in Q.
Let B be a leaf bag of D′ that is farthest from L in D and B′ be the unique bag adjacent
with B in D′. Note that B′ ̸= L. Since B is S-unaﬀected, Lemma 7.3 implies that either
B is a complete bag or it is a star bag whose center is marked, and B′ is a star bag whose
center is adjacent with B.
We observe that D −V (B′) has exactly two connected components; the one consisting
of B and another component adjacent with L in D. Indeed, as we chose B as a farthest

26
EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
leaf bag from L in D, an additional component adjacent with B′ must consist of a single
(leaf) bag. However, this is impossible since B is the only leaf bag of D adjacent with B′
by Lemma 7.4. Now, B and B′ satisfy the condition of Reduction Rule 4, contradicting
the assumption that (G, k) is reduced under this rule.
Suppose that D′ is adjacent with at least three red bags, say R1, R2 and R3, in D. Since
D′ consists solely of blue bags, it does not contain a branch bag. Hence, at least one of
Ri’s, say R1, is a leaf bag of D. However, R1 could have been colored red only in (1),
that is, R1 is incident with S-aﬀected edge or it is S-aﬀected itself. In both cases, the bag
of D′ adjacent with R1 must be colored either by (1) or (2) of the coloring procedure, a
contradiction. This completes the proof.
□
Lemma 7.6. Let (G, k) be an instance reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5. Then,
the number of red bags in D is at most 3|S|.
Proof. An S-aﬀected edge causes at most two bags to be colored red in (1). An S-aﬀected
bag B causes at most two bags to be colored red in (2), that is, the bag itself and possibly
an adjacent bag if B is a leaf bag. Hence, the number of bags colored in (1)-(2), is at most
2|S|.
It remains to prove that the number of branch bags is at most |S|. Let B be the set of
branch bags. We create a graph F on the vertex set B such that two bags B1 and B2 in B
are adjacent in F if and only if there is a path of bags in D from B1 to B2 that does not
contain any other branch bag. Since such a path of bags is unique between any B1 and
B2 in D, F is clearly a tree.
Let L be a leaf of F. Since D −V (L) contains at least 3 connected components having
at least two bags, at least two of these components does not contain any other bag in B.
Consider an arbitrary component D′ of D−V (L) that contains at least two bags and does
not contain a bag of B. Lemma 7.5 implies that D′ contains a red bag. We argue that D′
contains either an S-aﬀected bag or an S-aﬀected marked edge. Suppose not, and notice
that the only red bag in D′ is the one adjacent with L in D. Let us call this bag B. By
Lemma 7.5, the connected components of D′ −V (B) must be singletons, consisting of a
leaf bag. There are at most one such component by Lemma 7.4 consisting of a leaf bag
B′. Then we can apply Reduction Rule 4 to B and B′, a contradiction. We conclude that
D′ contains either an S-aﬀected bag or an S-aﬀected marked edge.
Now, every leaf L of F can be associated with two connected components of D −V (L)
containing either an S-aﬀected bag or an S-aﬀected marked edge. Notice that the two
connected components, as a set of bags of D, associated to the set of all leaves in F are
pairwise disjoint. Therefore, the number of leaves of F is at most 1
2|S|. It follows that F
contains at most |S| vertices, thus the number of red bags colored in (3) is at most |S|.
This completes the proof.
□
Lemma 7.7. The number of connected components of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B) is at most 3|S|
and |R ∪Q| ≤6|S|.
Proof. Consider a tree F on the vertex set R in which any two red bag is adjacent if and
only if there is a path of bags in D containing no red bag. By Lemma 7.5, there is an
injection from the set of connected components of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B) to the set of edges
of F. Observe that F has at most |R| edges. By Lemma 7.6, we have |R| ≤3|S|, which
establishes the ﬁrst claimed bound. Lemma 7.4 implies that |Q| ≤|R|. The second bound
|R ∪Q| ≤6|S| follows immediately.

7.2. Reducing the length of a sequence of S-unaﬀected bags. We assume that the
instance (G, k) is reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, and 5. Let D′ be a connected
component of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B). We introduce three reduction rules that contribute to
bound the number of bags in D′. Let us ﬁx the sequence B1, · · · , Bm of bags of D′. For
1 ≤i < j < k ≤m, a bag Bj is called a (Bi, Bk)-separator bag if the center of Bj is
adjacent to neither Bj−1 nor Bj+1. For a (B1, Bm)-separator bag B we deﬁne
• η(B) := {v} if v is the center of B and there is no leaf bag adjacent to B,
• η(B) := X if there is a leaf bag B′ adjacent to B, and X is the set of unmarked
vertices in B′.
Below, we present a rule that gives a bound on the number of (B1, Bm)-separator bags.
We remark that for every bag Bj in D′ with 1 < j < m other than (B1, Bm)-separator
bags, there are no leaf bags having Bj as a neighbor bag: if Bj has a leaf bag as a neighbor,
such a leaf bag must be S-aﬀected because of Lemma 7.3. Then Bj is a red bag by the
coloring procedure (3), contradicting that Bj is a bag in D′.
Reduction Rule 6. Let Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, Ba4 be (B1, Bm)-separator bags of D′ such that 1 ≤
a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 ≤m, for each i ∈{1, . . . , 3} there are no (Bai, Bai+1)-separator bags.
If there is a bag Bz where a2 < z < a3, then we remove all unmarked vertices in Bz.
Lemma 7.8. Reduction Rule 6 is safe.
Proof. Suppose there is a bag Bz where a2 < z < a3, and let v be an unmarked vertex of
Bz. We claim that there is no DH obstruction containing v, which shows that v can be
safely removed. Suppose for contradiction that there is a DH obstruction F containing v.
Since the set of all unmarked vertices in D′ induces a distance-hereditary graph, F must
contain at least one vertex from S. Notice that η(Ba2) ∪η(Ba3) is a separator between v
and S and since any DH obstruction is 2-connected, F contains at least two vertices of
η(Ba2)∪η(Ba3). That each η(Bai) is a twin set in G while F contains no twins imply that
F contains exactly vertex from η(Ba2) ∪η(Ba3) respectively. A similar argument shows
F contains exactly one vertex from η(Bai) for each i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}. Furthermore, as every
vertex in S cannot be adjacent to both Ba1 and Ba4, we have |F| ≥7, and thus F is an
induced cycle.
For each i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}, let wi be the vertex in V (F) ∩η(Bi).
If v is contained in a complete bag, then F contains an induced cycle of length 3 together
with vertices w2 and w3, contradiction. We may assume v is contained in a star bag. So,

v is adjacent to one of w2 and w3. Since F has no leaves, there is a neighbor v′ of v in F
that is not in {w2, w3}. Since v′ is also contained in a star bag, v′ is adjacent to one of w2
and w3 that is not adjacent to v. However, this implies that F contains an induced cycle
of length 4, contradiction. Therefore, v cannot be contained any DH obstruction, and we
can safely remove it.
□
We can observe that after applying Reduction Rule 6 exhaustively, if Ba1, Ba2, . . . , Bat
be the sequence of (B1, Bm)-separator bags where t ≥4 and a1 < a2 < · · · < at, then for
each i ∈{2, . . . , t −2}, ai+1 = ai + 1, that is, there are no bags between Bai and Bai+1.
We describe how we reduce the number of (B1, Bm)-separator bags.
Reduction Rule 7. Let Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, Ba4, Ba5 be (B1, Bm)-separator bags of D′ such that
1 ≤a1 < a2 < · · · < a5 ≤m, and for each i ∈{1, . . . , 4}, there are no (Bai, Bai+1)-
separator bags. We ﬁrst remove Ba3 and also remove the leaf bag adjacent to Ba3 if one
exists, and link marked vertices of Ba2 and Ba4 in D′, which were adjacent to Ba3, by a
marked edge. If |η(B2)| > |η(B3)| = 1, then we remove the leaf bag adjacent to Ba2, and
if |η(B2)| > |η(B3)| ≥2, then we remove vertices in η(Ba2) except |η(Ba3)| many vertices.
Lemma 7.9. Reduction Rule 7 is safe. Furthermore, in the resulting graph, S is again a
good DH-modulator.
Proof. Let D′′ be the resulting canonical split decomposition, and let G′ be the resulting
graph. For each i ∈{1, . . . , 5}, let Ui := η(Bi). In the decomposition D′′, we deﬁne eU as
• eU := {v} if v is the center of Ba2 and there is no leaf bag adjacent to Ba2,
• eU := X if there is a leaf bag B adjacent to Ba2, and X is the set of unmarked
vertices in B.
Notice that G −(U2 ∪U3) = G′ −eU. We prove that (G, k) is a Yes-instance if and only
if (G′, k) is a Yes-instance.
First suppose that G has a vertex set T such that |T| ≤k and G −T is distance-
hereditary.
Assume that T contains no vertex in U2 ∪U3.
We claim that G′ −T is
distance-hereditary. Suppose for contradiction that G′ −T contains a DH obstruction
F. If F does not contain a vertex in eU, then F is an induced subgraph of G −T, as
G −(U2 ∪U3) = G′ −eU. Thus, F contains a vertex in eU, and since eU is a set of pairwise
twins in G′, we have |V (F) ∩eU| = 1. Let v be the vertex in V (F) ∩eU. We observe that
• F contain at least one vertex from each of U1, U4, U5,

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
29
• the vertices in V (F) ∩˜U and V (F) ∩U4 have no neighbors in S,
• every vertex in S is not adjacent to both η(B1) and η(B5).
These imply that F is an induced cycle of length at least 6. Thus we can obtain an induced
cycle of length at least 7 in G from F by replacing v with a vertex of U2 and a vertex of
U3, contradiction. We conclude that G′ −T is distance-hereditary when T ∩(U2 ∪U3) = ∅.
Hence, we assume T ∩(U2 ∪U3) ̸= ∅. As Ui is a set of pairwise twins in G, if T ∩Ui ̸= ∅,
then Ui ⊆T. We can observe that (T \ (U2 ∪U3)) ∪eU is a solution to (G′, k) and we have
|(T \ (U2 ∪U3)) ∪eU| ≤|T| ≤k. It implies that (G′, k) is a Yes-instance.
For the converse direction, suppose that G′ has a vertex set T ′ such that |T ′| ≤k and
G′ −T ′ is distance-hereditary. We ﬁrst assume that T ′ ∩eU = ∅. Suppose G −T ′ has a
DH obstruction F. We have V (F) ∩(U2 ∪U3) ̸= ∅, otherwise F is an induced subgraph
of G′ −T ′. As U2 and U3 are twin sets of G, F contains at most one vertex from each
of U2 and U3. Furthermore, F contains exactly one vertex from each of U1, . . . , U5, and
thus it is an induced cycle of length at least 7. We can obtain an induced cycle of length
at least 6 in G′ −T ′ from F by contracting the edge between V (F) ∩U2 and V (F) ∩U3,
which contradicts to the assumption that G′ −T ′ is distance-hereditary. We conclude that
G −T ′ is distance-hereditary in the case when T ′ ∩eU = ∅.
Lastly, suppose T ′ ∩eU ̸= ∅. As eU is a set of pairwise twins in G′, we have eU ⊆T ′.
We obtain a set T from T ′ by removing eU, and adding Ui with i ∈{2, 3} where |Ui| =
min{|U2|, |U3|}.
If |U2| = |U3|, then we add one of them chosen arbitrarily.
Clearly,
|T| ≤|T ′| ≤k. We can observe that G −T has no DH obstruction containing a vertex in
U2 ∪U3. Since G −(U2 ∪U3) = G′ −eU has no DH obstructions, we conclude that G −T
is distance-hereditary, as required.
This proves that Reduction Rule 7 is safe.
We argue that S is again a good DH-
modulator in G′.
We need to verify that for every v ∈S, G′ −S \ {v} has no DH
obstructions. Suppose for contradiction that G′ −S \ {v} contains a DH obstruction F
for some v ∈S. The obstruction F should contain a vertex in eU, otherwise, F is also a
DH obstruction in G[(V (G)\S)∪{v}]. Observe that F should contain at least one vertex
from U1, U4, U5, and thus F is an induced cycle of length at least 6, and the neighbors
of v in F are contained in U1 and U4. Thus we can obtain an induced cycle of length at
least 7 by replacing the vertex in V (F) ∩eU with a vertex of U2 and a vertex of U3 in G,
which implies that G[(V (G) \ S) ∪{v}] contains a DH obstruction. It contradicts to our
assumption that S is a good DH-modulator. We conclude that S is a good DH-modulator
in the resulting graph.
□
In the following reduction rule, we describe how to reduce a sequence of non-(B1, Bm)-
separator bags.
Reduction Rule 8. Let a be a positive integer such that a ≤m −(5k + 11), and for each
i ∈{1, . . . , 5k + 10}, Ba+i is not a (B1, Bm)-separator bag. Among bags in {Ba+i : 1 ≤
i ≤5k + 10}, we mark up to k + 1 bags for each types : complete bags, star bags Bj
whose centers are adjacent to Bj+1, and star bags Bj whose centers are adjacent to Bj−1.
Choose a bag Ba+j with j ∈{1, . . . , 5k+10} that is not marked after ﬁnishing the marking
procedure, and remove vertices in Ba+j from G.

30
EUN JUNG KIM AND O-JOUNG KWON
We observe the every DH obstruction can be turned into an induced path by removing
a vertex v. Note that this vertex is not unique; for instance, we can choose any vertex in
an induced cycle of length 5. We will use this observation.
Lemma 7.10. Reduction Rule 8 is safe.
Proof. Suppose there is a bag Ba+j with j ∈{1, . . . , 5k + 10} that is not marked after
ﬁnishing the marking procedure in Reduction Rule 8, and let v be an unmarked vertex in
Ba+j. We prove that (G, k) is a Yes-instance if and only if (G −v, k) is a Yes-instance.
The forward direction is clear. Suppose that G −v has a vertex set T with |T| ≤k such
that (G −v) −T is distance-hereditary and G −T contains a DH obstruction F. Note
that v ∈V (F). Let b := a + (5k + 11).
We partition the vertex set V (G) into four parts. Let U be the set of all unmarked
vertices contained in Ba+1, Ba+2, . . . , Bb−1. Since D′ consists of only blue bags, there are
exactly two sets N1 and N2 in {NG(x) ∩U : x ∈V (G) \ U} that correspond to marked
edges e(Ba, Ba+1) and e(Bb−1, Bb), respectively. We deﬁne
• Ai := {x ∈V (G) \ U : NG(x) ∩U = Ni} for each i ∈{1, 2}.
It is clear that A1 and A2 are disjoint. Let W := V (G) \ (U ∪A1 ∪A2).
We ﬁrst show some necessary lemmas.
Claim 3. If F is an induced cycle of length at least 5, then |V (F) ∩U| ≤2.
Proof of the Claim: Suppose F is an induced cycle of length at least 5, and F contains
at least three vertices w1, w2, w3 in U. Since each wi is contained in either N1 or N2, at
least two vertices of w1, w2, w3 are contained in the same set of N1 and N2. By relabeling
if necessary, we assume that w1 and w2 are contained in the same set, say N1. Let Bx
and By be the two bags containing w1 and w2, respectively, and without loss of generality,
we may assume x ≤y. Then every neighbor of w1 in G is adjacent to w2, and therefore,
F contains a cycle of length 4 as a subgraph. This contradicts to the fact that F is an
induced cycle of length at least 5. We conclude that |V (F) ∩U| ≤2.
♦
Claim 4. If F is a DH obstruction that is not an induced cycle, then |V (F) ∩U| ≤4.
Proof of the Claim: If |V (F) ∩U| ≥5, then |V (F) ∩S| ≤1, contradicting to the
assumption that S is a good DH-modulator.
♦
Claim 5. If there are two vertices v1 ∈A1 and v2 ∈A2 such that v1v2 /∈E(G), then for
every i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −5}, bags Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2, Bi+3, Bi+4 contain three vertices
w1, w2, w3 where G[{v1, v2, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.
Proof of the Claim: Suppose there exist v1 ∈A1 and v2 ∈A2 such that v1v2 /∈E(G).
Let i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −5}. We prove three special cases.
Case 1. (There exist x, y, z ∈{i, i + 1, . . . , i + 4} with x < y such that Bx is a star bag
whose center is adjacent to Bx+1, By is a star bag whose center is adjacent to By−1, and
Bz is a complete bag.)
Let w1, w2, w3 be unmarked vertices of Bx, By, Bz, respectively. Since v1w2w1v2 is an
induced path and w3 is adjacent to both v1 and v2, by Lemma 2.2, G[{v1, v2, w1, w2, w3}]
is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.
Case 2. (There exist x, y, z ∈{i, i + 1, . . . , i + 4} with x < y < z such that Bx and Bz
are complete bags, and By is a star bag.)

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
31
Let w1, w2, w3 be unmarked vertices of Bx, By, Bz, respectively. Assume By is a star
bag whose center is adjacent to By−1.
Since w2v1w3v2 is an induced path and w1 is
adjacent to both w2 and v2, by Lemma 2.2, G[{v1, v2, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic to a DH
obstruction. If By is a star bag whose center is adjacent to By+1, then w2v2w1v1 is an
induced path and w3 is adjacent to both w2 and v1, G[{v1, v2, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic
to a DH obstruction.
Case 3. (There exist x1, x2, x3, x4 ∈{i, i+1, . . . , i+4} with x1 < x2 < x3 < x4 such that
Bx1 and Bx3 are star bags whose centers are adjacent to the next bags, and Bx2 and Bx4
are star bags whose centers are adjacent to the previous bags.)
Let w1, w2, w3, w4 be unmarked vertices of Bx1, Bx2, Bx3, Bx4, respectively. It is not
hard to verify that G[{v1, v2, w1, w2, w3, w4}] is isomorphic to the domino.
Now we prove in general. Since D is a canonical split decomposition, one of Bi and
Bi+1 is either a complete bag or a star bag whose center is adjacent to the next bag. Let
Bi′ be such a bag. Assume Bi′ is a complete bag. Then Bi′+1 is a star bag. If there is
a complete bag among Bi′+2, Bi′+3, then the claim holds by Case 2. Otherwise, all of
Bi′+1, Bi′+2, Bi′+3 are star bags, and the claim holds by Case 1.
Assume Bi′ is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bi′+1. If all of Bi′+1, Bi′+2, Bi′+3
are star bags, then the claim holds by Case 3. We may assume there exists a complete
bag in Bi′+1, Bi′+2, Bi′+3. If two other bags are star bags whose centers are adjacent to
the next bags, then the claim holds by Case 2. Otherwise, there is a star bag whose
center is adjacent to the previous bag, and the claim holds by Case 1.
♦
Claim 6. If there are three vertices v1 ∈A1, v2 ∈A2, v3 ∈W such that v1v2, v2v3, v3v1 ∈
E(G), then for every i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −4}, bags Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2, Bi+3 contain two
vertices w1, w2 where G[{v1, v2, v3, w1, w2}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.
Proof of the Claim: Suppose there are three vertices v1 ∈A1, v2 ∈A2, v3 ∈W such
that v1v2, v2v3, v3v1 ∈E(G). Let i ∈{a+1, a+2, . . . , b−4}. We prove three special cases.
We observe that there is x ∈{i, i + 1, i + 2, i + 3} such that either
(1) Bx is a complete bag and Bx+1 is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bx,
(2) Bx is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bx+1 and Bx+1 is a complete bag, or
(3) Bx and Bx+1 are star bags and their centers are adjacent.
Since D is a canonical split decomposition, one of Bi and Bi+1 is either a complete bag
or a star bag whose center is adjacent to the next bag. Let Bi′ be such a bag. Assume
Bi′ is a complete bag. Then Bi′+1 is a star bag. If its center is adjacent to Bi′, then the
statement (1) holds. We may assume the center of Bi′+1 is adjacent to Bi′+2. If Bi′+2 is
a complete bag, then the statement (2) holds, and if Bi′+2 is a star bag whose center is
adjacent to Bi′+1, then the statement (3) holds. Assume Bi′ is a star bag whose center is
adjacent to Bi′+1. If Bi′+1 is a complete bag, then the statement (2) holds, and if Bi′+1
is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bi′, then the statement (3) holds.
Let w1 ∈Bx, w2 ∈Bx+1 be unmarked vertices for such bags Bx and Bx+1. One can
observe that in any case, G[{v1, v2, v3, w1, w2}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.

Claim 7. If there are four vertices v1 ∈A1, v2 ∈A2, v3, v4 ∈W such that v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v4v1 ∈
E(G) and v1v3, v2v4 /∈E(G), then for every i ∈{a+1, a+2, . . . , b−3}, bags Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2
contain two vertices w1, w2 where G[{v1, v2, v3, v4, w1, w2}] contains an induced subgraph
isomorphic to a DH obstruction.

Proof of the Claim: Suppose there are four vertices v1 ∈A1, v2 ∈A2, v3, v4 ∈W such
that v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v4v1 ∈E(G) and v1v3, v2v4 /∈E(G). Let i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −3}.
If Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2 contains a complete bag, then an unmarked vertex w in the bag satisﬁes
that G[{v1, v2, v3, v4, w}] is isomorphic to the house. We may assume those bags are star
bags. Then there is i′ ∈{i, i + 1} such that Bi′ is a star bag whose center is adjacent to
Bi′+1 and Bi′+1 is a star bag whose center is adjacent to Bi′. Let w1 ∈Bi′, w2 ∈Bi′+1 be
unmarked vertices. One can observe G[{v1, v2, v3, v4, w1, w2}] is isomorphic to the domino.
♦
Now, we prove the result based on the previous claims.
Suppose |V (F) ∩U| = 1.
In this case, by the marking procedure of Reduction Rule 8, there are distinct integers
j1, j2, . . . , jk+1 ∈{1, . . . , 5k + 10} \ {j} such that Ba+j, Ba+j1, Ba+j2, . . . , Ba+jk+1 have
the same type (recall that Ba+j is an unmarked bag in the application of Reduction 8 abd
v ∈Ba+j). Therefore, there is a vertex v′ not contained in T, where v and v′ have the same
neighborhood on V (F)\{v}, which implies that G[(V (F)\{v})∪{v′}] is a DH obstruction
of (G −v) −T. This is contradiction. Thus, we may assume that |V (F) ∩U| ≥2.
We choose q ∈V (F) such that F −q is an induced path, and
• q = v if F is an induced cycle,
• q is the closest vertex to v in the underlying cycle if F is either the house, the
gem, or the domino.
Let P := F −q, and let w and z be the end vertices of P, and let w′ and z′ be the neighbors
of w and z in P, respectively.
We divide into following four cases depending on the places of w and z:
(1) Both w and z are contained in U.
(2) One of w and z is in A1 ∪A2 and the other is contained in U.
(3) Both w and z are contained in A1 ∪A2.
(4) One of w and z is contained in W.
We aim to show that these cases are not possible, because (G−v)−T is distance-hereditary.
First observe that w and z are not contained in U together. Suppose w and z are
contained in U. Let Bx and By be the bags containing w and z, respectively. We can
assume x ≤y, otherwise the proof is symmetric. Since they are not adjacent, either Bx is
a star whose center is adjacent to Bx−1 or By is a star whose center is adjacent to By+1.
By symmetry, assume that By is a star bag whose center is adjacent to By+1. Since q is
adjacent to both w and z, Bx should be either a complete bag, or a star bag whose center
is adjacent to Bx+1. Then z′ should be also adjacent to w, contradicting to the fact that
F −q is an induced path.
Secondly, assume that one of w and z is in A1 ∪A2 and the other is contained in U.
We assume that w ∈A1 and z ∈U.
For the other cases (w ∈A2 and z ∈U) and
(z ∈A1 and w ∈U) and (z ∈A2 and w ∈U), we can prove in the similar way. Since
wz /∈E(G), z is contained in a star bag Bx whose center is adjacent to Bx+1 for some
x ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −1}. Furthermore, if z′ ∈U, then z′ should be adjacent to w,
a contradiction. Thus, we have z′ ∈A2. Note that w, z′ /∈T and wz′ /∈E(G). Since
b −a −1 ≥5(k + 2), by Claim 5, there exists i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −5} such that bags
Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2, Bi+3, Bi+4 contain three vertices w1, w2, w3 where w1, w2, w3 /∈T ∪{v}
and G[{w, z′, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.
This contradicts to the
assumption that (G −v) −T is distance-hereditary.

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
33
Thirdly, assume that both w and z are contained in A1 ∪A2. If w and z are contained
in distinct sets of A1 and A2, then by the same argument in the previous paragraph, there
exists i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −5} such that bags Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2, Bi+3, Bi+4 contain three
vertices w1, w2, w3 where w1, w2, w3 /∈T ∪{v} and G[{w, z, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic to
a DH obstruction. Thus, we may assume both w and z are contained in Ai for some
i ∈{1, 2}. Without loss of generality, we assume w, z ∈A1. Suppose there are at least
k + 5 bags Bx in {Ba+1, Ba+2, . . . , Bb−1} that are either complete bags or star bags whose
centers are adjacent to Bx−1. Note that by Claims 3 and 4, |V (F)∩U| ≤4. Thus, there is
a bag among them having no vertex in T ∪V (F), and an unmarked vertex in the bag will
form a DH obstruction with P in (G−v)−T. Therefore, there are at most k+4 such bags.
This implies that there are at most 2k+9 bags, as there are no two consecutive bags in the
canonical split decomposition. It contradicts to our assumption that b −a −1 ≥5k + 10.
Lastly, we assume that one of w and z is contained in W. If q = v, then w or z cannot
be in W. Especially, F is a DH obstruction that is not an induced cycle. Let q′ be the
vertex of degree 3 other than q if F is the domino. Let us assume w ∈W. The proof is
symmetric when z ∈W.
If q ∈W, then {q, w, w′, z} ⊆A1 ∪A2 ∪W.
Since |V (F) ∩U| ≥2, F should be
isomorphic to the domino and V (F) ∩U = {q′, z′}. But since q is adjacent to q′, this is
contradiction. Therefore, we have q ∈A1 ∪A2. We remark that if V (F) ∩Ai = ∅for
some i ∈{1, 2}, then (V (F) ∩U, V (F) ∩(W ∪A3−i)) is a split of F, contradicting the fact
that F has no splits. Hence, it holds that V (F) ∩Ai ̸= ∅for i ∈{1, 2}. We divide cases
depending on whether F is isomorphic to the domino or not.
Case 1. F is not isomorphic to the domino.
Note that {q, w, w′} ⊆A1 ∪A2 ∪W. Since |V (F)| = 5 and |V (F) ∩U| ≥2, we have
V (F) ∩U = {z, z′}.
Furthermore, q and w′ are contained in distinct sets of A1 and
A2. By Claim 6, for every i ∈{a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b −4}, Bi, Bi+1, . . . , Bi+3 contain two
vertices w1 and w2 where G[{q, w, w′, w1, w2}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction.
As
b −a −1 ≥4(k + 2), there is a pair of such vertices w1 and w2 not contained in T ∪{v}.
So, (G −v) −T contains a DH obstruction, which is contradiction.
Case 2. F is isomorphic to the domino.
Recall that q is chosen as the vertex of degree 3 in F closer to v. Since q /∈U, v is a
vertex of degree 2. Furthermore, since w ∈W, we have z = v.
Note that w′ ∈W∪A1∪A2. Suppose q and w′ are contained in distinct sets of A1 and A2.
Since b−a−1 ≥5(k+2), by Claim 5, there exists i ∈{a+1, a+2, . . . , b−5} such that bags
Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2, Bi+3, Bi+4 contain three vertices w1, w2, w3 where w1, w2, w3 /∈T ∪{v}
and G[{q, w′, w1, w2, w3}] is isomorphic to a DH obstruction. If q and w′ are contained in
the same set of A1 or A2, then z should be adjacent to w′, contradiction. Thus, we can
conclude that w′ ∈W. Therefore, q′ /∈U, and {z, z′} ⊆U. Since q′ is not adjacent to z,
q and q′ are contained in distinct sets of A1 and A2.
Now, by Claim 7, for every i ∈{a+1, a+2, . . . , b−3}, bags Bi, Bi+1, Bi+2 contain two
vertices w1, w2 where G[{w, w′, q, q′, w1, w2}] contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to
a DH obstruction. As b −a −1 ≥3(k + 2), there is a pair of such vertices w1 and w2 not
contained in T ∪{v}. So, (G −v) −T contains a DH obstruction, which is contradiction.
We proved that |V (F) ∩U| ≥2 cannot hold when (G −v, k) is a Yes-instance. We
conclude that (G, k) is a Yes-instance if and only if (G −v, k) is a Yes-instance.

7.3. The size of a non-trivial component.
Lemma 7.11. Let (G, k) be an instance reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
8 and let D be the canonical split decomposition of a non-trivial connected component of
G −S. If D′ be a connected component of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B), then D′ contains at most
20k + 52 bags.
Proof. Let B1, · · · , Bm be a sequence of bags in D′. By Reduction Rule 7, D′ contains
at most four (B1, Bm)-separator bags Bj, and by Reduction Rule 6, if there are four
(B1, Bm)-separators bags, then there are no bags between the second and third (B1, Bm)-
separator bags. Also, there is at most leaf bag adjacent to a (B1, Bm)-separator bag, and
there are no leaf bags adjacent to a non-(B1, Bm)-separator bag. By Reduction Rule 8,
there are at most 5k + 11 consecutive bags Bj that are not (B1, Bm)-separator bags. In
total, D′ contains at most 4(5k + 11) + 4 · 2 = 20k + 52 bags.
□
We summarized the main result of this section.
Lemma 7.12. Let (G, k) be an instance reduced under Reduction Rules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
8 and let D be the canonical split decomposition of a non-trivial connected component of
G −S. Then D has at most 3|S|(20k + 54) bags.
Proof. Lemma 7.7 states that |R ∪Q| ≤6|S| and there are at most 3|S| connected com-
ponents of D −S
B∈R∪Q V (B).
By Lemma 7.11, each connected component of D −
S
B∈R∪Q V (B) contains at most 20k + 52 bags. Therefore, D contains at most 6|S| +
3|S|(20k + 52) = 3|S|(20k + 54) bags.

8. Polynomial kernel for Distance-hereditary Vertex Deletion
We present a proof of Theorem 1.1 in this section.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst prove that given an instance (G, k) and a good DH-modulator
S, one can output an equivalent instance of size O(k5|S|5). We ﬁrst apply Reduction Rule 2
to (G, k) with S. After that, G −S has O(k2|S|) non-trivialial connected components or
we can correctly report that (G, k) is a No-instance by Lemma 6.4. Notice that S remains
a good DH-modulator after the application of Reduction Rule 2 by Lemma 6.3.
We apply Reduction Rules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 exhaustively. The ﬁrst three rules can
be applied exhaustively in polynomial time by Lemma 7.2. Polynomial-time applicability
of Reduction Rules 7, and 8 is straightforward. We remark that S remains a good DH-
modulator after each application of Reduction Rules 3, 4 and 5 by Lemma 7.2.
Also
Reduction Rules 6 and 8 preserves S as a good DH-modulator since these rules delete
vertices not contained in S. The application of Reduction Rule 7 preserves the goodness of
S by Lemma 7.9. Then the canonical split decomposition D of each non-trivial connected
component of G −S has at most 3|S|(20k + 54) bags by Lemma 7.12.
Then apply Reduction Rule 1 exhaustively in polynomial time. This bounds the size of
a twin set in G −S by O(k2|S|3) by Lemma 5.2. We note that the unmarked vertices of a
bag form at most two twin sets. Therefore, the number of unmarked vertices in a bag is
bounded by O(k2|S|3) by Lemma 5.2. Especially, the same bounds apply to the number
of trivial components in G −S since they form an independent set in G −S.
Let (G′, k′) be the resulting instance. Combining the previous bounds altogether, we
conclude that V (G′) = O(k5 · |S|5).

A POLYNOMIAL KERNEL FOR DISTANCE-HEREDITARY VERTEX DELETION
35
We may assume that the input instance (G, k) satisﬁes n ≤2ck for some constant c.
Recall that there is an algorithm for Distance-hereditary Vertex Deletion running
in time 2ck ·nO(1) by Eiben, Ganian, and Kwon [10]. If n > 2ck, then the algorithm of [10]
solves the instance (G, k) correctly in polynomial time, in which case we can output a
trivial equivalent instance. By Theorem 4.2, we can obtain a good DH-modulator S of
size O(k5 log n) = O(k6) in polynomial time or correctly report (G, k) as a No-instance.
The previous argument yields that in polynomial time, an equivalent instance (G′, k′)
of size O(k35) can be constructed. Now, applying Theorem 4.2 again4 to (G′, k′), we can
either correctly conclude that (G′, k′), and thus (G, k), is a No-instance or output a good
DH-modulator S′ of size O(k5 log k). Now we obtain a kernel of size O(k30 · log5 k).
□
9. Concluding remarks
Apparently, there is much room to improve the kernel size O(k30 log5 k) presented in
this work.
It is not diﬃcult to convert our approximation algorithm in Theorem 3.1
to an O(opt2 log n)-approximation algorithm. It is an intriguing question to obtain an
approximation algorithm with better performance ratio. This will immediately improve
our kernelization bound of this paper.
Given a DH-modulator S, Proposition 4.1 states that extra factor of O(k2) will be
incurred per vertex in S in the course of obtaining a good DH-modulator.
In fact, a
good DH-modulator of size O(k|S|) can be constructed in polynomial time using Mader’s
S-path theorem. Given a collection S of disjoint vertex sets in G, an S-path is a path
whose end vertices belong to distinct sets in S. Mader’s S-path theorem provides a primal-
dual characterization of the maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint S-paths. From
S-path theorem, one can show the following alternative to Proposition 4.1.
Proposition 9.1. Let G be a graph without any small DH obstruction, v be a vertex of
G such that G −v is distance-hereditary and k be a positive integer. In polynomial time,
one can decide whether there is k + 1-sunﬂower at v or ﬁnd a set X ⊆V (G) \ {v} of size
at most 2k such that G −X contains no induced cycle of length at least 5 traversing v.
This proposition holds because the property of distance at most two in G −v between
neighbors of v gives an equivalent relation, and thus hitting induced cycles of length at
least 5 traversing v can be translated to hitting all paths linking two distinct equivalent
classes, and we can use Mader’s S-path Theorem.
The caveat here is that the polynomial time algorithm in this proposition calls as a
subroutine an algorithm which can eﬃciently compute both a primal and a dual optimal
solutions of Mader’s characterization. Lovasz [24] showed that S-path packing problem
and the min-max duality is a special case of linear matroid parity problem and the cor-
responding duality. Matroid parity problem is NP-hard even with a compact representa-
tion [24], but for linear matroid it can be eﬃciently solved. We can use such an algorithm
A, for example [24] or [5] for a more recent treatement. Moreover, the optimal dual so-
lution satisfying Mader’s S-path theorem can be eﬃciently computed via computing an
optimal dual solution for the corresponding linear matroid parity problem, see [25].
In this paper, we give a simpler-to-describe algorithm using an approximation algorithm
for Vertex Multicut instead of relying on a reduction to linear matroid parity problem.
An interesting question is, can we eﬃciently ﬁnd the primal and dual optimal solution

satisfying Mader’s S-path theorem without using a reduction to linear matroid parity
problem? We are not aware of any literature claiming such a result.
One might also ask for a kernelization lower bound for Distance-hereditary Vertex
Deletion parameterized by the size of a DH-modulator or by k.
