Abstract. Intrinsic random functions (IRF) provide a versatile approach when the assumption
of second-order stationarity is not met. Here, we develop the IRF theory on the circle with its
universal kriging application. Unlike IRF in Euclidean spaces, where diﬀerential operations are
used to achieve stationarity, our result shows that low-frequency truncation of the Fourier series
representation of the IRF is required for such processes on the circle. All of these features and
developments are presented through the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In addition,
the connection between kriging and splines is also established, demonstrating their equivalence on
the circle.

1. Introduction. When a random process is considered on a circle, it is often assumed to
be second-order stationary (or stationary for short in the paper), that is, the mean of the pro-
cess is constant over the circle and the covariance function at any two points depends only on
their angular distance (Yaglom, 1961, Roy, 1972, Roy and Dufour, 1974, Dufour and Roy, 1976,
Wood, 1995, Gneiting, 1998). While stationarity is commonly assumed, it is often considered to
be unrealistic in practice. In Euclidean spaces, a large class of non-stationary phenomena may be
represented through intrinsic random functions (IRF, Matheron, 1973, Cressie, 1993, Chil`es and
Delﬁner, 2012). The properties of IRF in other spaces, such as the circle or sphere, are not widely
known. In this paper, the theory of IRF on the circle is developed, where we ﬁnd that instead of
diﬀerential operations, truncation of the Fourier series representation becomes essential for IRF on
the circle. This can be presented in the context of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS,
Aronszajn, 1950, Wahba, 1990a). We formally make such a connection and further relate universal
kriging with the smoothing formula in RKHS. Based on this approach, we are able to demonstrate
the equivalence between splines and kriging on the circle.
2. IRF and RKHS. A key component for IRF is the allowable measure. Based on Matheron
(1973) and Chil`es and Delﬁner (2012, Chapter 4), a discrete measure λ = Pm
i=1 λiδ(ti) on a unit
circle S, where ti ∈S, λi ∈R and δ(·) is the Dirac measure, is allowable at the order of an integer
κ(κ ≥0) if it annihilates all trigonometric functions of order k < κ. That is,
m
X
i=1
λi cos(kti) =
m
X
i=1
λi sin(kti) = 0,
0 ≤k < κ.
(1)
We call Λκ the class of such allowable measures. Clearly Λκ+1 ⊂Λκ. In addition, for λ ∈Λκ, the
translated measure ιtλ = Pm
i=1 λiδ(ti + t), t ∈S remains in Λκ. This can be easily seen from the
elementary trigonometric identities (also see Matheron, 1979, Chil`es and Delﬁner, 2012). For any
function f(·) on S, we deﬁne f(λ) = Pm
i=1 λif(ti).
In this paper, we consider a random process {Z(t), t ∈S} on a unit circle with ﬁnite second
moment and being continuous in quadratic mean. By Yalgom (1961) and Roy (1972), the process
can be expanded in a Fourier series which is convergent in quadratic mean:
Z(t) = Z0 +
∞
X
n=1
(Zn,c cos nt + Zn,s sin nt),
(2)

where Z0 = 1/(2π)
R
S Z(t)dt, Zn,c = (1/π)
R
S Z(t) cos ntdt, and Zn,s = (1/π)
R
S Z(t) sin ntdt.
Deﬁnition 2.1. For an integer κ(κ ≥0), the random process in (2) is called an IRFκ if for any
λ ∈Λκ, the process
Zλ(t) = Z(ιtλ) =
m
X
i=1
λiZ(ti + t)
is stationary with respect to t ∈S and has a zero mean.
To characterize such a circular IRFκ, we denote
Zκ(t) =
∞
X
n=κ
(Zn,c cos nt + Zn,s sin nt),
as its low-frequency truncated process and so we have the following Lemma.
Lemma 2.1. A random process given by (2) is an IRFκ if and only if its low-frequency truncated
process Zκ(t) is stationary and has a zero mean.
Proof. In the Fourier expansion (2), the lower trigonometric functions will be annihilated by λ ∈Λκ,
which implies
Z(ιtλ) =

Denote λn,c = Pm
i=1 λi cos nti, λn,s = Pm
i=1 λi sin nti and
Yn,c = Zn,cλn,c + Zn,sλn,s,
Yn,s = −Zn,cλn,s + Zn,sλn,c,
n = κ, κ + 1, . . . ,
(3)
we have
Z(ιtλ) =
∞
X
n=κ
(Yn,c cos nt + Yn,s sin nt).
Yaglom (1961, Theorem 5) shows that a random process (2) on the circle is stationary if and only
if its Fourier coeﬃcients are uncorrelated random variables. The Lemma can be directly obtained
based on this and the linear mapping between the coeﬃcients of (Zn,c, Zn,s) and (Yn,c, Yn,s) in
(3).

Remark 2.1. In Euclidean spaces, the IRF is associated with diﬀerential operations (Matheron,
1973, Chil`es and Delﬁner, 2012). For example, a diﬀerentiable IRFκ on a real line is characterized
as that its (κ + 1) derivative is stationary. Lemma 2.1 indicates that for circular processes, the
low-frequency truncation operation replaces diﬀerential operations and leads to stationarity. This
observation also has important implications for splines on the circle, which is addressed in Section 4.
Remark 2.2. It is clear that an IRF0 on the circle is the conventional stationary process. Note
that this is slightly diﬀerent from what has been deﬁned in the Euclidean spaces, where IRF(−1)
is usually a stationary process. For the rest of this paper, we assume κ ≥1 for notational simplicity.
Remark 2.3. Based on Lemma 2.1, for an IRFκ process Z(t), the random process
Z∗(t) = Z(t) + A0 +
κ−1
X
n=1
(An,c cos nt + An,s sin nt),
where A0, An,c, An,s, n = 1, . . . , (κ −1) are random variables, is clearly also an IRFκ. These two
processes Z(t) and Z∗(t) share the same truncation process Zκ(t), with Z∗(λ) = Z(λ), for any
λ ∈Λκ. Similar to the discussion in Chil`es and Delﬁner (2012, Section 4.4.2), these functions form
an equivalent class.
To obtain the covariance function of Zκ(t) of an IRFκ, based on Yaglom (1961) or Roy (1972),
we denote
E(Zn,cZm,c) = E(Zn,sZm,s) = δ(n −m)γn,
with γn > 0, n ≥κ, and P∞
n=κ γn < ∞. Here δ(n −m) = 1 if n = m and 0 otherwise. This leads to
cov(Zκ(x), Zκ(y)) =
∞
X
n=κ
γn cos n(x −y) := φ(x −y),
x, y ∈S.
This covariance function φ(·) plays an essential role in our paper, and is named as the intrinsic
covariance function of the IRFκ.
Remark 2.4. Another component in IRF is the generalized covariance function. For an IRFκ
on the circle, it is clear that φ(·) is a candidate of te generalized covariance function.
By the
annihilation property of allowable measures, any function which is the sum of φ(·) and a linear
4

combination of lower trigonometric functions up to order κ −1 can also be a generalized covari-
ance function. A basic property of the generalized covariance function in Euclidean spaces is its
conditional positive deﬁniteness. Such a property (Levesley et al. 1999) seems less important on
the circle. One can clearly show that φ(·) is conditional positive deﬁnite of order κ, and positive
deﬁnite simultaneously (Schoenberg, 1942). For example, it is noted by Yaglom (1961) that the
space of valid variograms coincides with the space of valid covariances.
RKHS was introduced in Aronszajn (1950), and is popularly used in the spline literature (see,
for example, Wahba, 1990a). Taijeron et al. (1994) and Levesley et al. (1999) have studied RKHS
in the context of spline interpolation and smoothing on the circle and sphere. Here, we formally
establish the connection between IRF and RKHS on the circle. First, given an IRFκ process and
its intrinsic covariance function φ(θ) = P∞
n=κ γn cos nθ, γn > 0, one can deﬁne a function space Xκ
on S, following Levesley et al. (1999)
Xκ =
(
f(t) = a0 +
∞
X
n=1
(an,c cos nt + an,s sin nt), t ∈S :
∞
X
n=κ
1
γn
(a2
n,c + a2

)
.
For f, g ∈Xκ, a semi-inner product is deﬁned
⟨f, g⟩κ =
∞
X
n=κ
1
γn
(an,c,fan,c,g + an,s,fan,s,g).
(4)
There is a nil space for this semi-inner product N = span{1, cos t, sin t, . . . , cos(κ−1)t, sin(κ−1)t}.
Denote l = dim(N), and it is clear that l = 2κ −1. Let {τ1, . . . , τl ∈S} be a set of distinct points
such that for every p(·) ∈N, if p(τν) = 0 for all ν = 1, . . . , l, then p ≡0. Then, the inner product
⟨f, g⟩=
l
X
ν=1
f(τν)g(τν) + ⟨f, g⟩κ
is well deﬁned and Xκ can be shown to be complete with respect to the norm induced by this
inner product (Levesley et al.
1999).
In addition, there exist p1(t), . . . , pl(t) ∈N, such that
pν(τµ) = δ(ν, µ) for 1 ≤ν, µ ≤l. As discussed in Levesley et al. (1999), the space Xκ is a Hilbert
function space in which point evaluations are continuous linear functionals. Therefore, for x, y ∈S,
there exists a reproducing kernel
H(x, y) = φ(x−y)−

Proposition 2.1. H(x, y) is positive deﬁnite for x, y ∈S.
Proof. By the expansion of φ(θ) = P∞
n=κ γn cos(nθ), we have
H(x, y) =

pν(x)pν(y) +

.
The positive deﬁniteness of H(x, y) can be obtained through the symmetry in x and y along with
γn > 0 for all n ≥κ.
Remark 2.5. We show that for an IRFκ on the circle, there exists a corresponding RKHS.
Conversely, given the positive deﬁniteness of H(x, y), there exists a Gaussian random process that
is an IRFκ with H(x, y) as its covariance function. Therefore, the connection between IRF and
RKHS on the circle has been formally established.
Remark 2.6. One can easily verify the reproducing property of this kernel (Taijeron et al.
1994, Light and Wayne, 1995, Levesley et al. 1999). The diﬀerent choice of the distinct points
{τ1, . . . , τl} will alter the form of the reproducing kernel with φ(·) unchanged since the terms con-
taining pν(·) will all be annihilated by λ ∈Λκ.
3. Univesal kriging. Universal kriging associated with IRF is widely used in spatial statistics
(Cressie, 1989, Chil`es and Delﬁner, 2012). In this Section, we will discuss universal kriging on
the circle. Let Z(t) be an IRFκ with an intrinsic covariance function φ(·) and the mean function
E(Z(t)) = Pl
ν=1 βνqν(t), where βν, ν = 1, . . . , l are coeﬃcients and span{q1(t), . . . , ql(t)} = N.
Here qν(·) can be the elementary lower trigonometric functions or {pν(t)}l
ν=1 given in Section 2.
Assume that the data {(ti, yi), i = 1 . . . , n}, n ≥l, are observed from this IRFκ with measurement
error
Y (t) = Z(t) + ǫ(t),
t ∈S,
where ǫ(·) is a white noise process with mean zero that is uncorrelated with the process Z(·).
6

To obtain the best linear unbiased estimator at t0 ∈S, the universal kriging is commonly used,
where the linear estimator is
ˆZ(t0) = ηT y,
y = (y1, . . . , yn)T ,
with coeﬃcients η = (ηi)n×1. The unbiasedness leads to ηT Q = qT , where
Q = {qν(ti)}n×l,
q = (q1(t0), . . . , ql(t0))T ,
and therefore Pn
i=1 ηiqj(ti) = qj(t0), j = 1, 2, . . . , l, which implies
n
X
i=1
ηiδ(ti) −δ(t0) ∈Λκ.
(6)
Hence, the squared prediction error can be shown to be
E( ˆZ(t0) −Z(t0))2 = σ2ηT η + ηT Ψη −2ηT φ + φ(0),
where
Ψ = {φ(ti −tj)}n×n,
φ = (φ(t1 −t0), . . . , φ(tn −t0))T .
The goal of universal kriging is to minimize the squared prediction error, subject to the unbiasedness
constraints. Letting a vector ρ of l × 1 be the Lagrange multipliers, we need to minimize
M(η) = σ2ηT η + ηT Ψη −2ηT φ + φ(0) + 2(ηT Q −qT )ρ.
Direct computation ﬁnds the universal kriging formula as



(Ψ + σ2I)η + Qρ = φ,
QT η = q.
(7)
Next, we show that this universal kriging formula can be interpreted in the content of RKHS.
With this IRFκ Z(·) and the observed data {(ti, yi), i = 1 . . . , n}, n ≥l, the smoothing problem is
to ﬁnd a function fα(t) ∈Xκ such that it minimizes (Taijeron et al. 1994, Levesley et al. 1999)
n

i=1
(yi −f(ti))2 + α∥f∥2
κ,
where α > 0 is the smoothing parameter and ∥· ∥κ is induced by the semi-inner product (4) in
Section 2. The minimizer can be shown to be
fα(t) =

where c = (ci)n×1 and d = (dν)l×1 satisfy the following,



(Ψ + αI)c + Qd = y,
QT c = 0l×1.
To show the connection between this smoothing formula and universal kriging (7), note that the
smoothing formula for an unobserved point t0 ∈S can be rewritten in the following manner
fλ(t0) = (c, d)T

φ

or



QT η∗= q.
(9)
Remark 3.1. This equation (9) is exactly the dual formula of universal kriging (Cressie, 1993,
Chil`es and Delﬁner, 2012). Usually, universal kriging is viewed as a linear estimator of observed
data and the smoothing formula is viewed as linear combination of the intrinsic covariance with
lower trigonometric trends. From the above discussion, these two views are essentially the same.
The connection between universal kriging and the smoothing formula, therefore, is obvious.
Remark 3.2. The smoothing parameter α in (9) and the noise variance σ2 in (7) play the
same role. For example, in the smoothing formula, when α increases to inﬁnity, the minimization
procedure demands ∥f∥κ ↓0, which shows that c →0, and the smoothing formula reduces to the
trigonometric regression (Eubank, 1988). In kriging practice, when σ2 increases to inﬁnity, the
noise overwhelms the spatial dependency, the process becomes uncorrelated. The squared predic-
tion error is dominated by σ2ηT η. The universal kriging reduces to minimize ηT η subject to the
unbiasedness restriction, which also leads to trigonometric regression prediction. When both α and
σ2 decrease to zero, both smoothing and kriging result in exact interpolation.

Remark 3.3. In this paper, we extend IRF to the circular setting through the RKHS theory.
In so doing, we ﬁnd that the lower monomials in Euclidean spaces need to be replaced by lower
trigonometric functions, and the diﬀerential operators need to be replaced by low-frequency trun-
cations. The RKHS sheds light into kriging on the circle and provides elementary understanding.
This RKHS approach allows us to revisit splines on the circle, see Section 4.1.
4. Examples and discussions.
4.1 Spline on the circle. In Craven and Wahba (1979) and Wahba (1990a), the spline on the
circle is the minimizer of
n
X
i=1
(yi −f(ti))2 + αJ(f),
where
J(f) =
Z
S
(f (m)(t))2dt,
(10)
This minimizer has been shown to be (Wahba, 1990a)
fα(t) = d +
n
X
i=1
ciR(ti, t),
with
R(s, t) = 2
∞
X
n=1
1
n2m cos n(s −t).
Remark 4.1. This is the smoothing formula (8) for κ = 1, where the intrinsic covariance
function φ(·) is replaced by R(s, t). Note that the spline kernel R(s, t) is a speciﬁed function, for
example,
m = 1,
R(s, t) = (s −t)2
2
−π|s −t| + π2
3 ,
m = 2,
R(s, t) = −(s −t)4
24
+ π|s −t|3
6
−π2(s −t)2
6
+ π4
45.
These kernels R(s, t) are clearly positive deﬁnite (Schoenberg, 1942) on the circle, and are valid
covariance functions.
Remark 4.2. In Euclidean spaces, the order m in (10) plays a signiﬁcant role. It indicates the
smoothness assumption of the function, and relates to the order of IRF in kriging (Kent and Mardia,
1994). However, for this spline on the circle, this order m only alters the covariance functions (see
9

Remark 4.1), and loses its connection to the order κ of IRF. Therefore, the spline with derivative
penalty has limited application for circular processes. As shown in Lemma 2.1, the low-frequency
truncation operation shall be used, leading to the more appropriate spline model on the circle
1
n
n
X
i=1
(yi −f(ti))2 + α∥f∥2
κ,
(11)
where ∥· ∥κ is induced by the semi-inner product (4) in Section 2. A more general approach for
hyperspheres can be found in Taijeron et al. (1994).
4.2. Splines and kriging. The spline model (11) is exactly the same as the smoothing for-
mula in Section 3, where the equivalence between the smoothing formula and kriging is discussed.
It is clear that this spline (11) and kriging are also equivalent on the circle. The RKHS theory
on the circle oﬀers a clear view of this connection. In addition, following Remark 3.1, spline is
a linear combination of the intrinsic covariance functions with lower trigonometric trends, while
universal kriging is a linear estimator of observed data. They arrive at the same conclusion as dual
formulations of kriging (Cressie, 1993).
The connections between splines and kriging have been extensively discussed in literature, in-
cluding Matheron (1981), Watson (1984), Lorenc (1986), Cressie (1989, 1990, 1993), Wahba (1990a,
1990b), Kent and Mardia (1994), Laslett (1994), Furrer and Nychka (2007) among others. Furrer
and Nychka (2007) show that, given a covariance function, one can construct a reproducing kernel
and obtain a general spline estimate in Euclidean space. In this paper, we show this connection
formally for circular processes using the IRFs.
4.3. Ordinary kriging. The ordinary kriging is well known and has been widely used in a
variety of spatial analysis contexts. On the circle, ordinary kriging is equivalent to the universal
kriging developed in Section 3 with κ = 1. The process Z(t) is IRF1 with mean and covariance
E(Z(t)) = β1,
cov(Z(x), Z(y)) = H(x, y) = φ(x −y) −φ(x −τ1) −φ(y −τ1) + φ(0) + 1.
The process is not stationary, but a direct computation gives var(Z(x)−Z(y)) = 2φ(0)−2φ(x−y).
That is, the variance of the process at two points only depends on their circular distance and we
10

can deﬁne
τ(θ) := φ(0) −φ(θ) =
∞
X
n=1
γn(1 −cos nθ),
as the semi-variogram (Schoenberg 1942, Huang et al.
2011).
The process can be viewed as
intrinsically stationary on the circle. Note that φ(θ) relates to the semi-variogram directly through
(Huang et al. 2011)
φ(θ) = c0 −τ(θ),
c0 ≥1
π
Z π
0
τ(θ)dθ.
Therefore, with τ = (τ(t1 −t0), . . . , τ(tn −t0))T , 1n = (1, 1, · · · , 1)T , and Γ = {τ(ti −tj)}, we have
the kriging estimator
fα(t0) = ηT y,
where η satisﬁes
−Γη + ρ1n = τ,
1T
nη = 1.
This is exactly the ordinary kriging in the spatial literature (Cressie, 1993).
4.4. Brownian bridge. The Brownian bridge {B(t), t ∈S} is a random process on the circle
with mean zero and
cov(B(s), B(t)) = 2π min{s, t} −st,
s, t ∈S.
It is clearly not a stationary process. However, for any allowable measure λ = Pm
i=1 λiδ(ti) ∈Λ1
(hence Pm
i=1 λi = 0),
cov(B(ιtλ), B(ιsλ)) =
m
X
i,j=1
λiλj{2π min{ti + t, tj + s} −(ti + t)(tj + s)}
= −π
m
X
i,j=1
λiλj|ti + t −tj −s| + (1/2)
m
X
i,j=1
λiλj(ti + t −tj −s)2,
where the last equality is based on 2 min{a, b} = (a + b) −|a −b|, a > 0, b > 0 and Pm
i=1 λi = 0.
That is, B(ιtλ) is stationary with respect to t, showing that the Brownian bridge is an IRF1.
On the other hand, one can consider the Fourier series representation of the Brownian bridge
B(t) = B0 +
∞
X
n=1
(Bn,c cos(nt) + Bn,s sin(nt)).
11

Direct computation shows that for all n, m ≥1, E(Bn,cBm,c) = E(Bn,sBm,s) =
2
n2 δ(m, n) and
E(Bn,cBm,s) = 0. Therefore, the truncated process B1(t) = P∞
n=1(Bn,c cos(nt) + Bn,s sin(nt)) is
clearly stationary, and so the Brownian bridge is an IRF1 by Lemma 2.1. In addition, its intrinsic
covariance function is given by φ(s −t) = 2 P∞
n=1
1
n2 cos(n(s −t)), which is exactly the same as
the R(s, t) with m = 1 in Subsection 4.1. However, we have E(B0Bn,c) = −2
n2, n ≥1, that is,
B0 is correlated with all Bn,c, n ≥1. Such a coupling reveals that the Brownian bridge is not sta-
tionary. But, by truncation this coupling is removed, and the truncated process becomes stationary.
