Abstract  
Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) monolayers 
and heterostructures has attracted significant attention due to its promising potential for 
next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. A key factor in stabilizing long-
range magnetic order in these systems is magnetic anisotropy, which plays a crucial 
role in overcoming the limitations imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This 
review provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental overview of the 
importance of magnetic anisotropy in enabling intrinsic 2D magnetism and shaping the 
electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW materials. We begin by 
summarizing the fundamental mechanisms that determine magnetic anisotropy, 
emphasizing the contributions from strong ligand spin-orbit coupling of ligand atoms 
and unquenched orbital magnetic moments. We then examine a range of material 
engineering approaches, including alloying, doping, electrostatic gating, strain, and 
pressure, that have been employed to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy in these 
materials. Finally, we discuss open challenges and promising future directions in this 
rapidly advancing field. By presenting a broad perspective on the role of magnetic 
anisotropy in 2D magnetism, this review aims to stimulate ongoing efforts and new 
ideas toward the realization of robust, room-temperature applications based on 2D vdW 
magnetic materials and their heterostructures.

1. Introduction  
Magnetic anisotropy is a fundamental and essential physical property of magnetic 
materials, describing the tendency of magnetizations to preferentially align along 
specific crystallographic directions. Microscopically, magnetic anisotropy can be 
broadly categorized into three primary components: (i) magnetocrystalline anisotropy 
(MCA), (ii) magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA), and (iii) exchange anisotropy. MCA, 
the most prevalent form of magnetic anisotropy, arises from the interaction between 
magnetic ions and their surrounding crystal field via spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This 
interaction introduces directional preferences for magnetizations that depend on the 
material’s symmetry and electronic structure. In contrast, MSA originates from long-
range dipole–dipole interactions among magnetic moments. A defining feature of MSA 
is its strong dependence on the geometry of magnetic materials.[1] While MSA is 
typically negligible in three-dimensional (3D) bulk magnets due to its relatively weak 
strength compared to MCA, it becomes increasingly significant in low-dimensional 
systems—particularly in magnetic thin films and quasi-two-dimensional materials.[2] 
Considering that two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are 
atomically thin, MSA is expected to play a crucial role in determining their magnetic 
properties. Exchange anisotropy, in contrast, arises from the interplay between SOC 
and the intrinsic crystal symmetry of magnetic materials. In general, lower crystal 
symmetries combined with strong SOC enhance the likelihood of exchange anisotropy, 
which in turn modifies the preferred directions of magnetizations and influences the 
overall magnetic ordering. This form of anisotropy is particularly significant in systems 
where interfacial effects or competing magnetic interactions are present. A clear 
understanding of the distinct contributions from all types of magnetic anisotropy—
including exchange anisotropy—is essential for effectively tuning the magnetic 
properties of materials, especially in the context of spintronic applications and low-
dimensional magnetic systems. 
As research into 2D magnetism continues to progress, a growing consensus has 
emerged around the pivotal role of magnetic anisotropy in stabilizing long-range 
magnetic orders and enabling the emergence of complex magnetic phases in 2D 
magnetic materials. According to the well-known Mermin-Wagner theorem,[3] long-
range ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders are forbidden at finite 
temperatures in isotropic Heisenberg spin systems due to the divergence of thermal spin 
fluctuations in low dimensions. This theoretical limitation, however, assumes the 
absence of magnetic anisotropy, which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry and 
opens an energy gap in the spin-wave spectrum, thereby suppressing long-wavelength 
fluctuations that would otherwise destabilize magnetic orders. Experimental findings 

Page 3 of 73 
 
over the past several decades have clearly demonstrated that long-range magnetic 
ordering can, in fact, persist in 2D systems when magnetic anisotropy is present. Early 
studies in the 1960s revealed long-range FM order in ultrathin NiFe films as thin as a 
few atomic layers.[4] More recently, the isolation of atomically thin vdW magnetic 
materials has reinvigorated interest in this field. Landmark discoveries include the 
observation of long-range FM order in CrI3 monolayers (MLs) in 2017,[5] and 2D long-
range AFM orders in FePS3 MLs in 2016.[6, 7] These findings not only suggest the 
crucial role of magnetic anisotropy in overcoming the constraints of the Mermin-
Wagner theorem but also underscore its importance in guiding the design of 2D 
magnetic materials for applications in spintronics, quantum information, and 
topological devices.

Within the framework of linear spin wave theory, it is understood that in 2D magnetic 
materials with continuous spin rotational symmetry, the gapless spin-wave excitations 
lead to a divergence in magnetization at finite temperatures, which destabilizes the 
long-range magnetic order. To circumvent this issue, such a divergence has to be 
eliminated. It has been demonstrated that even a small out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, 
which opens a finite spin-wave gap, can suppress the divergence and thereby stabilize 
long-range magnetic order in 2D magnetic systems.[12] Alternatively, long-range dipole-
dipole interactions inherently break spin rotational invariance, allowing them to 
stabilize long-range magnetic orders in 2D magnetic materials as well.[2] Therefore, for 
long-range magnetism to persist in 2D magnetic materials, the continuous spin 
rotational symmetry must be broken, either through out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy 
or long range dipole-dipole interactions. 
Due to the quenching of orbital magnetic moments in solids, MCA is typically very 
small, on the order of meV or sub-meV per magnetic atom. This weak magnitude makes 
it challenging to establish general principles governing both the magnitude and even 
the sign of magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). As a result, developing a systematic 
approach to controlling magnetic anisotropy in most 2D magnetic materials remains 
difficult, despite its critical role in tailoring their functionalities and applications. 
Understanding magnetic anisotropy primarily relies on density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations, which have provided key insights into its microscopic origins. Detailed 
electronic structure analyses reveal intricate connections between the wavefunctions of 
states near the Fermi level, SOC matrix elements, and the bandwidths of specific 
magnetic materials. These findings highlight the fundamental role of electronic 
correlations and SOC-driven interactions in determining the anisotropic magnetic 
behavior of 2D magnetic materials. 
By determining the preferred orientation of magnetic moments, magnetic anisotropy 
also plays a crucial role in shaping the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties 
of 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures. One notable consequence is 
the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which arises from changes in the Fermi surface 
induced by the rotation of magnetization direction.[13-15] When 2D ferromagnetism 
coexists with nontrivial topological band structures, magnetic anisotropy—particularly 
with out-of-plane magnetization—can enable the realization of exotic quantum states 
such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and the axion insulator phase.[16]

Furthermore, when monolayer valley semiconductors are interfaced with 2D vdW 
magnetic materials, magnetization (either out-of-plane or in-plane) can induce valley 
splitting, thereby facilitating the practical implementation of valley Hall effects.[17] 
Magnetic anisotropy also interplays with other fundamental magnetic interactions, such 
as Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, which can 
stabilize topologically nontrivial spin textures, including magnetic skyrmions and 
bimerons.[9] Altogether, MLs or few-layer heterostructures of vdW magnetic materials 
provide a fertile platform for engineering anisotropy-driven functionalities. 
From the perspectives of applications, 2D vdW magnets and their heterostructures 
offer tremendous potential in emerging fields such as spintronics, topotronics, and 
valleytronics. By integrating 2D vdW magnetic materials with nonmagnetic metals or 
insulators into heterostructures, one can realize a range of spintronic devices, including 
spin valves, magnetic tunnel junctions, spin field-effect transistors, and spin tunnel 
field-effect transistors, which serve as fundamental components for high-density 
information storage, advanced information processing, magnetic sensing, and non-
volatile memory technologies.[18-20] Moreover, the dissipationless edge states associated 
with the QAHE and the topological magnetoelectric coupling in axion insulators 
position these materials and their heterostructures as key candidates for next-generation 
low-power electronic devices and magnetoelectric random access memory.[16, 21] In the 
context of valleytronics, magnetic exchange-induced valley splitting in 2D vdW 
heterostructures enables controllable valley polarization, an essential prerequisite for 
devices such as valley splitters,[22] valley separator[23] and controllable valley Hall effect  
transistor.[24, 25] Furthermore, the ability of certain 2D vdW magnets to host magnetic 
skyrmions, topologically protected spin textures considered promising as information 
carriers, opens up avenues for designing ultra-dense racetrack memory and spin-based 
logic devices.[26, 27]  
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the electronic and 
magnetic properties, as well as the advanced functionalities, of two-dimensional van 
der Waals magnetic materials and their heterostructures, with particular emphasis on 
the role of magnetic anisotropy and the underlying physics (Figure 1). We begin by 
discussing the critical role of magnetic anisotropy in stabilizing long-range magnetic 
order in 2D vdW systems. We then review the physical mechanisms that give rise to 
magnetic anisotropy across a range of 2D vdW magnetic materials, including both 
insulating and metallic systems, and explore how spin orientation affects their 
electronic, magnetic, and topological properties. Given the pivotal role of magnetic 
anisotropy in tuning magnetic behavior and emergent quantum phenomena, we also 
highlight diverse strategies for engineering anisotropy through both external and 

Page 6 of 73 
 
intrinsic means, including alloying, doping, strain, gating, and applied pressure. Finally, 
we conclude with a discussion of the current challenges and future opportunities in the 
study of magnetic anisotropy in 2D vdW magnets and their heterostructures. This 
review is specifically dedicated to magnetic anisotropy, with a focus on 2D vdW 
magnetic materials that have been experimentally realized, as well as their 
heterostructures. For broader discussions on other aspects of 2D magnetism, we refer 
readers to several excellent reviews.[28-34]  
 
2. Importance of Magnetic Anisotropy for 2D vdW Magnets 
When magnetization is rotated from its preferred orientation (i.e., the magnetic easy 
axis) to a direction of higher energy (i.e., the magnetic hard axis), the associated energy 
cost, known as the MAE, typically ranges from sub µeV to a few meV per atom. 
Although this energy scale is small compared to the total magnetic energy of a material, 
magnetic anisotropy plays a disproportionately significant role in stabilizing long-range 
magnetic order in 2D magnetic materials. Before delving into its role in enabling 2D 
magnetism, we first provide a detailed introduction to the three main components of 
magnetic anisotropy. 
2.1 An Overview of Magnetic Anisotropy

where α  and β  run over x, y, and z axes,

between spins at sites i and j. This 3-by-3 matrix is generally determined by the crystal 
symmetries of magnetic materials and has been simplified to many different forms. For

 , also contribute to magnetic anisotropy by 
introducing anisotropic spin couplings that favor specific spin orientations. These 
interactions have been identified in spin-orbit-entangled Kitaev materials such as α-
RuCl3 and Na2IrO3, where they play a significant role in shaping the magnetic ground 
states and excitations.[44-46]  
For many magnetic materials of interest, the MCA in their spin Hamiltonians can be

where
iAαβ  is the MCA parameter. This form of anisotropy reflects its single-ion nature, 
therefore it is referred to simply as single-ion anisotropy (SIA). For 2D vdW magnetic 
materials with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, the MCA is either out-of-plane or in-plane. 
Therefore, their MCA is often simplified by a spin Hamiltonian,

In all magnetic materials, dipole-dipole interactions are inherently present due to the 
magnetic moments associated with spins. The contribution of the magnetostatic 
interaction to the spin Hamiltonian is given by[2]

where the sum runs over all pair of spin sites i and j; mi is the local magnetic moment 
at site i and rij is the vector connecting sites i and j. Clearly, the dipole-dipole interaction 
is long-ranged, since it decays slowly with the distance as 1/r3. In particular, it depends 
on both the relative magnetic moment orientation of two spins and their orientation with 
respect to rij. As a result, the dipole-dipole interactions break the rotational symmetry 
between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations in a magnetically ordered 2D 
system, energetically favoring in-plane spin alignment over out-of-plane orientation. 
This effect induces a geometrically driven in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which 
becomes particularly significant in 2D vdW MLs where SOC is weak. Therefore, 
dipole-dipole interactions constitute an intrinsic source of magnetic anisotropy in 2D 
systems, contributing to the stabilization of specific spin textures and magnetic phases. 
2.2 Mermin-Wagner Theorem 
We now turn to the well-known Mermin–Wagner theorem, formulated in 1966, 
which plays a central role in understanding magnetic order in low-dimensional 
systems.[3] This theorem states that at finite (non-zero) temperatures, no long-range FM 
or AFM order can exist in one- or two-dimensional isotropic spin-S Heisenberg models 
with finite-range exchange interactions. In contrast, 3D isotropic Heisenberg models 
can sustain long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, even though a complete 
rigorous solution is still lacking. This dimensional crossover underscores the crucial 
role of dimensionality in the emergence and stability of long-range magnetic order. 
From a physical perspective, the absence of long-range magnetic order in 2D isotropic 
systems arises from the proliferation of low-energy spin-wave excitations (i.e., 
Goldstone modes) at finite temperatures. These thermal spin fluctuations diverge in the 
thermodynamic limit, thereby destroying the long-range coherence of spin alignment. 
The Mermin–Wagner theorem therefore highlights the crucial role of symmetry-
breaking perturbations, such as magnetic anisotropy, in stabilizing magnetic order in 
two dimensions. While this result may seem discouraging for the exploration of low-
dimensional magnetic systems, it is important to emphasize that the Mermin–Wagner 
theorem relies on two key assumptions: (i) the exchange interactions between spins are 
isotropic, and (ii) the exchange interactions are short-range, decaying faster than 1/r3.[3, 
47] 
To gain a more intuitive understanding of the Mermin–Wagner theorem, let us 
consider an isotropic spin-S Heisenberg model on a 2D honeycomb spin lattice (Figure 
2E). For simplicity, we set the lattice basis vectors to be unit vectors. The spin 
Hamiltonian of this model is given by

(i.e., J > 0), and indices i and j run over the spin sites A and B. At zero temperature, the 
magnetic ground state of this model is a FM order with all spins aligning along the same 
direction (Figure 2E). At finite temperatures, thermal energy excits spins away from 
this aligned state. These excitations manifest as spin waves, or magnons, which are 
collective modes arising from the small-angle precession of spins around the ordered 
direction. Within the linear spin wave approximation, the energy spectrum for the spin 
wave (i.e. magnons) is

 . This divergence clearly indicates that the 
magnetization must be zero at a finite temperature. Hence, the FM order in the isotropic 
spin-S Heisenberg model on a 2D honeycomb lattice is destroyed by thermal excitations, 
consistent with Mermin-Wagner theorem.[3] 
By predicting the absence of long-range magnetic order in 2D isotropic spin systems 
at finite temperatures, the Mermin–Wagner theorem suggests fundamental limitations 
for the practical use of 2D magnets in spintronic applications, which typically require 
robust and controllable magnetic order. However, real 2D magnetic materials deviate 
significantly from the idealized conditions assumed by Mermin and Wagner. On one 
hand, the Heisenberg exchange interactions are rarely perfectly isotropic, owing to 
intrinsic low crystal symmetries and the presence of SOC. Notably, the SIA—an on-
site contribution that favors specific spin orientations—is not accounted for in the 
Mermin–Wagner framework. On the other hand, dipole–dipole interactions between 
magnetic moments, which are long-range in nature, also fall outside the scope of the 
theorem. These interactions break the spin-rotational symmetry and can energetically 
favor certain spin alignments, such as in-plane over out-of-plane orientations. The 
discrepancy between the assumptions of the Mermin–Wagner theorem and the realistic 
physical properties of 2D magnetic materials highlights the fundamental and practical 
importance of exploring how long-range magnetic orders emerge in real 2D systems. 
Both theoretical models incorporating magnetic anisotropies and experimental 
discoveries of 2D magnets with robust long-range order have shown that, despite the 
limitations of idealized models, 2D magnetic materials can indeed host rich and 
technologically promising magnetic phases. 
2.3 Early Studies of 2D Ferromagnetism in Magnetic Ultrathin Films  
As early as 1960s, 2D ferromagnetism in ultrathin magnetic films has already 
attracted research interest. Ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature (TC) of 220 K in 
NiFe ultrathin films with a thickness of 1.8 ML was reported by Gradmann for the first 
time in 1968.[4] During the period of 1980-2000, long-range FM orders with TCs from 

Page 11 of 73 
 
several to a few hundred Kelvins was experimentally observed in Fe, Co, and Ni MLs 
deposited on different substrates.[30] In an angle-resolved photoemission experiment, a 
magnetic exchange splitting similar to that of bulk Co was observed in Co ML grown 
on Cu(111) in 1982,[49] indicating the FM order in Co ML. Interestingly, the saturation 
magnetization of the Co ML grown on Cu(111) follows the solution of the 2D Ising 
model in a broad range of temperatures.[50]  
  A key insight from experimental investigations of magnetic ultrathin films is the 
critical role of magnetic anisotropies in governing their magnetic phase transitions.[51] 
Since magnetic anisotropies primarily originate from MCA and dipole-diploe 
interactions, 2D Heisenberg ferromagnets incorporating one or both of them are of 
fundamental interest for theoretical studies. As early as 1976, Maleev demonstrated that 
dipole-dipole interactions which decrease like 1/r3 lead to the stabilization of FM orders 
in 2D Heisenberg ferromagnets at nonzero temperature.[52] This stabilization arises 
because the long-range nature of dipole-dipole interactions gives rise to a linear 
momentum dependence in the spin wave spectra, which eliminates the divergence of 
the saturated magnetization, ∆𝑚𝑚(𝑇𝑇). In 1986, Yafet et al. obtained similar results in 
the noninteracting spin-wave approximation.[53] Two years later, Bander and Mills 
proved that a phase transition to ferromagnetism always occurs in 2D Heisenberg 
ferromagnets with an arbitrarily small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.[12] In 1991, 
Bruno discussed 2D Heisenberg ferromagnets with both dipole-dipole interactions and 
a uniaxial MCA using spin wave theory[47] and showed those: i) when the total magnetic 
anisotropy is perpendicular, the stabilization of FM orders at finite temperatures is due 
mainly to the perpendicular MCA induced gap at the bottom of spin wave spectra 
whereas dipole-dipole interactions play a negligible role; ii) when the magnetic 
anisotropy is in-plane, spin wave spectra are gapless so that the stabilization of the FM 
order is due to the long-range character of the dipole-dipole interactions. Note that the 
second result of Bruno’s study is consistent with the previous results in the works of 
Maleev[52] and Yafet.[53] Clearly, both experimental and theoretical investigations into 
magnetic ultrathin films consistently highlight the essential role of magnetic 
anisotropies in enabling the long-range FM orders in 2D magnetic materials.  
  As a concrete example, we revisit the isotropic spin-S Heisenberg model on a 2D 
honeycomb spin lattice to illustrate how magnetic anisotropies can stabilize long-range 
FM order in 2D. Within the framework of linear spin wave theory, a uniaxial magnetic 
anisotropy opens a finite spin wave gap, ∆, which suppresses low-energy excitations 
and enables the emergence of long-range order at finite temperatures. [47] With this gap, 
the low-temperature magnetization for ∆𝑘𝑘𝐵𝐵𝑇𝑇
⁄
≫1 is approximated by[47, 48]

Eq. (6) clearly shows that the presence of a spin wave gap eliminates the divergence of 
spin fluctuations, allowing the magnetization M(T) to persist at finite temperatures. 
Defining TC as the temperature at which the magnetization decreases to M(TC)=g𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵S/2, 
we roughly estimate TC within a mean field approximation by the following equation:[48]

2            (7). 
As shown in Figure 2G, the Curie temperature TC monotonically increases with the spin 
wave gap, which is determined by the MAE. Therefore, strong uniaxial magnetic 
anisotropy is essential for achieving high-TC ferromagnetism in 2D magnetic materials.  
2.4 Experimental Characterization of van der Waals Magnetic Materials 
Although magnetic ultrathin films have served as a valuable platform for studying 
2D magnetism, their strong dependence on surface and substrate conditions often 
complicates the interpretation of experimental results. Recent years have seen a surge 
in experimental investigations into 2D vdW magnetic materials, driven by their promise 
for spintronic applications and fundamental studies of low-dimensional magnetism. 
Experimental efforts have focused on probing magnetic ordering, anisotropy, spin 
dynamics, and tunability under external stimuli such as strain, gating, and layer stacking. 
In particular, vdW materials have weak interlayer interactions and minimal 
environmental sensitivity, offer an ideal alternative for fundamental studies of 2D 
magnetism. Inspired by the discovery of graphene exfoliated from graphite using 
adhesive Scotch tape, [54] many magnetic vdW monolayers can similarly be obtained 
through mechanical exfoliation, making them both experimentally accessible and 
attractive for fundamental and applied research.[28-30, 32, 55] In contrast to the 
complexities associated with defect-induced ferromagnetism in otherwise non-
magnetic 2D vdW materials such as graphene,[56-58] the magnetism in monolayer and 
few-layer vdW magnetic materials is intrinsic, more reproducible, and significantly 
more robust. These materials also exhibit higher magnetization, making them far more 
amenable to experimental investigation and enabling clearer insights into the 
fundamental physics of two-dimensional magnetism. 
A major breakthrough in the study of atomically thin 2D magnetism was the 
successful exfoliation of the vdW transition-metal phosphorus trisulfide FePS3 in 
2016.[6, 7] FePS3 is an AFM material of particular interest for 2D magnetism because its 
magnetism can be well described by a 2D Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, due to 
its strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy (Figure 3A).[59, 60] Remarkably, Ising-type 

Page 13 of 73 
 
AFM order persists down to the ML limit, with a Néel temperature exceeding 100 K, 
as independently confirmed by two groups using Raman scattering techniques (Figure 
3B-3C).[37] This discovery is fundamentally important for several reasons. First, it 
provides experimental verification of the long-theorized phase transition in a 2D Ising 
system, originally proved by Onsager in 1944.[27] Second, it offers direct evidence for 
intrinsic magnetic ordering in vdW magnetic materials, making a significant conceptual 
advancement in condensed matter physics. From the perspective of magnetic anisotropy, 
the 2D Ising model can be viewed as a limiting case of the 2D Heisenberg model with 
infinitely strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, the presence of magnetic 
anisotropy in real 2D magnetic materials effectively violates the assumptions of the 
Mermin–Wagner theorem, thereby permitting the emergence of long-range magnetic 
order in two dimensions.

  Two other vdW transition-metal phosphorus trisulfides, MnPS3 and NiPS3, also serve 
as important testbeds for exploring 2D antiferromagnetism. A neutron diffraction study 
suggested that bulk MnPS3 exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy.[63] Kim et al.  
investigated the thickness dependence of the magnetic phase transition in MnPS3 using 
Raman spectroscopy and reported that AFM ordering remains surprisingly robust in the 
MnPS3 bilayer.[64] This was further supported by cryogenic second-harmonic 
generation microscopy measurement, which confirmed a Néel-type AFM order in the 
MnPS3 bilayer with a Néel temperature around 60 K.[65] Additionally, tunneling 
magnetoresistance measurements on atomically thin MnPS₃ crystals by Long et al. 
demonstrated that AFM order persists down to the monolayer limit (Figure 3D).[61] In 
contrast, bulk NiPS3 is considered an XXZ-type antiferromagnet.[66, 67] Kim et al. 
examined the evolution of AFM ordering in NiPS₃ through layer-dependent Raman 
spectroscopy and concluded that while AFM order persists in the bilayer, it is 
significantly suppressed in the monolayer limit. [68] However, a subsequent study using 
helicity-resolved Raman and ultrafast spectroscopy revealed that monolayer NiPS₃ 
remains magnetically ordered, undergoing a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) 
transition at TBKT ≈  140 K.[69] Overall, these findings demonstrate that despite 
dimensional reduction, two-dimensional antiferromagnetism can be sustained in van 
der Waals materials such as MnPS₃ and NiPS₃ due to the presence of magnetic 
anisotropy.  
  A neutron diffraction study revealed that MnPSe3 exhibits strong in-plane magnetic 
anisotropy.[70] As a result, MnPSe₃ serves as an excellent platform for exploring two-
dimensional magnetism described by the XY model with six-state clock order, 
consistent with its S6 point group symmetry. Using spatially resolved second-harmonic 
generation, Ni et al. provided direct evidence of long-range AFM order in MnPSe₃ ML 
(Figure 3E), along with Ising-type switching of the Néel vector.[62] Remarkably, they 
also demonstrated that applying uniaxial strain can rotate the Néel vector to align along 
arbitrary in-plane directions, independent of the underlying crystal axes. This strain-
induced reorientation suggests a tunable magnetic anisotropy and a change in the 
universality class of the magnetic phase transition, highlighting MnPSe₃ as a promising 
material for strain-engineered 2D magnetism. 
For most spintronic applications[71], 2D ferromagnetism is generally more 

Page 15 of 73 
 
desirable[72] than antiferromagnetism. A major breakthrough in this area came in 2017 
with the experimental discovery of intrinsic long-range FM order in few-layer 
Cr2Ge2Te6 and monolayer CrI3.[5, 73] Remarkably, Gong et al. demonstrated 
unprecedented magnetic field control over the FM transition temperature in few-layer 
Cr2Ge2Te6 (Figure 4A).[73] This behavior can be understood by recognizing that 
Cr2Ge2Te6 is a soft vdW magnetic material with a very small easy-axis SIA; thus an 
applied magnetic field effectively mimic the role of magnetic anisotropy in stabilizing 
long-rang FM order. A rapid increase in the FM transition temperature is observed under 
small magnetic fields. In contrast, CrI3 is a vdW ferromagnet with  strong easy-axis 
magnetic anisotropy.[5, 48] As a result, its robust ferromagnetism persists down to the 
ML limit even in the absence of magnetic field, as confirmed experimentally by Huang 
et al. (Figure 4B).[5] Furthermore, neutron scattering measurements by Chen et al. 
revealed that the FM phase transition in CrI3 is weakly first order and governed by SOC 
induced magnetic anisotropy[74] rather than magnetic exchange interactions as in 
conventional ferromagnets. Again, these findings underscore the critical role of 
magnetic anisotropy in stabilizing two-dimensional ferromagnetism in atomically thin 
vdW magnetic materials and highlight the tunability of their magnetic properties for 
potential spintronic applications.

As close relative of CrI3, CrBr3 is also a vdW ferromagnet.[78] Multiple experimental 
studies have confirmed that out-of-plane FM order can be retained in CrBr3 ML.[75, 79-
81] The TC of CrBr3 ML is 34 K, slightly lower than the bulk value (i.e., 37 K) (Figure 
4C).[75] While both CrBr3 and CrI3 MLs exhibit out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, the 
MAE of CrBr3 is about four times smaller than that of CrI3.[81] This relatively weaker 
anisotropy makes bilayer CrBr₃ an ideal platform for engineering non-collinear 
magnetic states via twisting.[81] It is worth mentioning that the strong out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy of CrI3 inhibits the formation of smooth non-collinear magnetic 
textures in twisted CrI3 bilayer.[81]  
Among the chromium trihalides CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), CrCl3 ML stands out due to its 
in-plane magnetic anisotropy, in contrast to the out-of-plane anisotropy observed in 
CrBr₃ and CrI₃.[76] Bedoya-Pinto et al. demonstrated that when a single CrCl₃ monolayer 
is epitaxially grown on a graphene/6H-SiC(0001) substrate, it exhibits robust FM 
ordering with critical behavior consistent with a two-dimensional XY model, below a 
TC of 13 K (Figure 4D).[76] This behavior arises from the in-plane rotational symmetry 
of the magnetic anisotropy in CrCl3 ML, enabling the realization of a finite-size BKT 
phase transition, and uncommon phenomenon in 2D vdW magnet. The emergence of 
XY-type magnetism in CrCl3 ML opens avenues for exploring 2D superfluid-like spin 
transport and topological excitations.[76] In contrast, few-layer CrCl3 exhibits insulating 
in-plane antiferromagnetic order, with a Néel temperature of approximately17 K, 
highlighting a dimensionality-driven evolution in magnetic ground states.[82, 83] 
Comparative studies across the CrX3 family reveal that magnetic anisotropy plays a 
pivotal role in determining the nature of their magnetic phases, dictating not only the 
spin alignment but also the universality class of their phase transitions.  
Similarly, CrSBr ML is a FM semiconductor with in-plane magnetic anisotropy,  
despite its bulk being a vdW antiferromagnet with an in-plane magnetic easy axis. [84] 
CrSBr ML can be readily obtained via exfoliation and possess a centrosymmetric 
crystal structure. Remarkably, the magnetism in CrSBr ML can be detected through 

Page 17 of 73 
 
magnetic-dipole-induced second harmonic generation (SHG), which enables probing 
of symmetry-breaking magnetic order in centrosymmetric systems. Using SHG, Lee et 
al. demonstrated the onset of FM ordering in CrSBr ML with a TC of 146 ± 2 K 
(Figure 4E-4F).[77] By investigating the square roots of the average SHG intensities as 
a function of temperature, they found that the FM phase is best described by the 
anisotropic Heisenberg model, rather than the Ising or XY models (Figure 4F). This 
anisotropic ferromagnetic order is likely driven by a combination of single-ion 
anisotropy (SIA) and anisotropic exchange interactions.[84] These findings highlight 
CrSBr ML as a rare example of a high-TC 2D magnetic semiconductor with complex 
anisotropic spin interactions, opening new opportunities for exploring magneto-optical 
phenomena and spintronic applications in centrosymmetric layered materials. 
Vanadium triiodide (VI3) is a vdW FM Mott insulator with a TC of approximately 50 
K in its bulk [85, 86] and is identified as a hard ferromagnet with a significant coercivity.[87] 
In contrast to the Ising ferromagnetism of CrI3, the magnetic easy axis in VI3 is not 
perpendicular to the layers; instead, it is canted by about 40° from the normal to the ab 
plane.[88] This complex magnetic anisotropy is likely rooted in the material's low-
symmetry crystal structure and the presence of bond-dependent Kitaev interactions.[88, 
89] Like CrI3, VI3 retain robust ferromagnetism down to the ML limit.[90] However, a 
surprising deviation from typical vdW magnets has been observed: Lin et al. reported 
an anomalous increase in TC with decreasing layer number, reaching a maximum of 60 
K in the VI3 ML, a reversal of the more commonly observed trend of suppressed 
magnetism in ultrathin limits.[90] This unusual thickness dependence may be linked to 
differences in stacking order between monolayer and bulk, particularly the loss of 
inversion symmetry, as well as the material’s intricate magnetic anisotropy. [90]  
Among 2D insulating vdW magnetic materials, MnBi2Te4 stands out as a unique 
system that intrinsically combines long-range magnetic order with nontrivial 
topological electronic properties.[91-93] In its bulk form, MnBi2Te4 is an AFM 
topological insulator (TI), exhibiting A-type AFM order with out-of-plane magnetic 
anisotropy and a Néel temperature of 24 K.[94, 95] Upon thinning to the 2D limit, 
MnBi2Te4 thin films display a unique thickness-dependent topological properties.[96] 
Remarkably, a zero-field QAHE has been observed in five-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 
specimen at 1.4 K, signaling the realization of a topologically nontrivial magnetic 
Chern insulator state in a stoichiometric compound without external doping or magnetic 
proximity.[97] In contrast, six-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 thin films have been shown to 
host a robust axion insulator state, characterized by a gapped surface spectrum in the 
presence of time-reversal-breaking AFM order, but without net chiral edge 
conduction.[98] In both cases, the presence of strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy 

Page 18 of 73 
 
is critical, as it ensures the stability of the spin alignment necessary for breaking time-
reversal symmetry—an essential ingredient for realizing these topological phases in 
thin films.

Nevertheless, the TC of most 2D insulating magnetic materials remain relatively low, 
limiting their practical utility in spintronic devices that require robust magnetism at 
higher temperatures. Under such circumstances, FM vdW metals are naturally noticed 
as they often exhibit significantly higher TC. A prototypical example is Fe3GeTe2, a 
metallic vdW ferromagnet with a bulk TC of about 220 K,[102] making it a promising 
candidate for realizing high-temperature 2D ferromagnetism. From a theoretical 
standpoint, Zhuang et al. employed density-functional theory to predict that Fe3GeTe6 
ML is a stable 2D Stoner ferromagnet with strong uniaxial MCA which favors robust 

Page 19 of 73 
 
out-of-plane spin alignment.[103] Experimentally, Fei et al. demonstrated that 
mechanically exfoliated Fe3GeTe2 ML exhibit long-range FM order with a TC of 130 
K,[104] while Deng et al., using an Al2O3-assisted exfoliation technique, reported  a 
lower TC of around 68 K in monolayer samples (Figure 5B-5C).[99] Despite the 
discrepancy in Curie temperatures reported by these independent studies—likely due 
to variations in sample quality, strain, or substrate effects—both groups confirmed the 
presence of strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in Fe3GeTe2 ML.[99, 104] Inspired 
by these findings, Fe₃GeTe₂ has emerged as a model system for investigating tunable 
two-dimensional metallic ferromagnetism, offering promising opportunities for the 
development of spintronic devices capable of operating at elevated temperatures. 
As changes in layer number and stacking significantly impact both crystal structure 
and magnetic properties of vdW magnets, it is instructive to compare the magnetic 
behaviors across the family FenGeTe2 (n = 3, 4, and 5). Figure 5A depicts the crystal 
structures of FenGeTe2, highlighting the progressive increase in Fe layers leading to a 
corresponding rise in the number of nearest-neighbor Fe atoms. This structural 
evolution is closely tied to the enhancement of magnetic ordering temperatures: the 
measured Curie Temperatures are about 220 K, 270 K and 310 K for Fe3GeTe2, 
Fe4GeTe2, and Fe5GeTe2 thin flakes, respectively.[102, 105, 106] However, FenGeTe2 
exhibits a different magnetic anisotropy when n goes from 3 to 5. First, Fe3GeTe2 is a 
hard magnet with a strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy.[107] In contrast, Fe4GeTe2 
has a temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropy. As shown in Figure 5D, its magnetic 
easy axis lies in the ab-plane at high temperature but undergoes a spin reorientation 
transition (SRT) to the out-of-plane c axis below a critical temperature (TSRT) of 110 
K.[14, 100, 105, 108, 109] Notably, in bilayer Fe4GeTe2, nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer 
measurements reveal a lower SRT temperature of approximately 80 K,[110] indicating 
dimensionality and thickness effects on the spin reorientation dynamics. Finally, 
Fe5GeTe2 introduces further complexity, exhibiting thickness-dependent magnetic 
behavior. In its bulk form, Fe5GeTe2 is a soft ferromagnet with either in-plane[111, 112] or 
out-of-plane[113-115] magnetic anisotropy, varying between samples. Upon exfoliation, 
thin Fe5GeTe2 flakes transition to a hard FM state, while the monolayer displays spin-
glass-like behavior, a hallmark of frustrated magnetic interactions and disorder.[111] 
Interestingly, bilayer Fe5GeTe2 grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) retains a FM 
phase with a high TC of 229 K,[116] underscoring the tunability of magnetic properties 
via growth technique and dimensional control. The contrasting behaviors, from robust 
2D ferromagnetism in Fe₃GeTe₂ ML to spin-glass-like magnetism in Fe₅GeTe₂ ML, 
highlight how anisotropy and structural dimensionality jointly dictate the emergence 
and nature of magnetism in vdW magnets.

Fe3GaTe2 is another promising vdW ferromagnet incorporating iron, notable for its 
above-room-temperature TC  up to the range of 350-380 K)[34,117]. Compared to 
Fe3GeTe2, Fe3GaTe2 possesses a stronger perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.[118] A 
perpendicularly large magnetic anisotropy constant KU=6.7×105 J/m3 has been reported 
at 300 K in a nine-unit-cell Fe3GaTe2 thin film.[101] Remarkably, even in the ultra-thin 
limit, the material retains robust magnetic order. In a one-unit-cell (i.e., trilayer) 
Fe3GaTe2 film, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy remains strong (KU=1.8×105 J/m3 
at 300 K), supporting FM ordering with a TC up to 345 K (Figure 5E-5F).[101] 
Furthermore, Wang et al. demonstrated that Fe3GaTe2 ML exhibits 2D hard 
ferromagnetism, with a record-high TC of 240 K among known intrinsic FM vdW MLs, 
based on Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements.[119] Fundamentally, the 
stabilization of 2D FM order in both Fe3GeTe2 and Fe3GaTe2 MLs can be attributed to 
the interplay of strong magnetic anisotropy and enhanced exchange interactions.

1T-CrTe2 ML is an intriguing 2D vdW magnetic materials whose magnetic ground 
state is highly sensitive to its in-plane lattice constant. Sun et al. demonstrated that FM 

Page 21 of 73 
 
order can persist above 300 K in ultra-thin 1T-CrTe2 films.[122] Using MBE, Zhang et 
al. grew 1T-CrTe2 ML on bilayer graphene and revealed a FM ground state with out-
of-plane magnetic anisotropy and a TC of about 200 K.[120] Similarly,  epitaxial growth 
of a one unit-cell thick 1T-CrTe2 film on ZrTe2 substrates results in a 2D ferromagnet 
exhibiting a clear anomalous Hall effect, indicative of robust FM ordering.[123] However, 
contrasting behavior is observed when 1T-CrTe2 ML is grown on a SiC-supported 
bilayer graphene, where a stable AFM order with moderate magnetic anisotropy 
emerges.[124] These substrate-dependent magnetic states are consistent with theoretical 
predictions showing that the magnetic ground state of 1T-CrTe₂ ML is strongly 
dependent on its in-plane lattice constant. [125] Specifically, when the in-plane lattice is 
constrained to match that of ZrTe2, the system favors a FM state with out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy, aligning well with the experimental observations.[123,126] 
𝛼𝛼-RuCl3, a vdW magnetic material based on a 4d transition metal, offers a distinct 
contrast to the more commonly studied 3d transition metal-based vdW magnets, making 
it a compelling platform for exploring 2D magnetism in the context of strong spin-orbit 
coupling and electronic correlations. Notably, 𝛼𝛼 -RuCl3 is widely considered as a 
promising candidate for realizing the long-sought Kitaev quantum spin liquid, owing 
to its honeycomb lattice and anisotropic exchange interactions.[45, 46, 127] With the rapid 
progress in 2D vdW magnetic materials research, α-RuCl3 ML has attracted increasing 
interest. DFT calculations predicted that introducing free carriers and optically excited 
electron-hole pairs can drive α-RuCl3 ML from a proximate spin-liquid phase into a 
stable FM state.[128] Biswas et al. showed via DFT calculations that interfacing α-RuCl3 
ML with graphene can induce an insulator-to-metal transition, open the door to realizing 
metallic and even exotic superconducting states in its engineered heterostructures.[129] 
Furthermore, it is reported in an experiment that the large work function and narrow 
bands of α-RuCl3 monolayer and bilayer enable the modulation doping of the exfoliated 
single-layer and bilayer graphene, highlighting its utility in vdW heterostructure 
engineering.[130] A particular interesting discovery is the reversal of magnetic 
anisotropy in α-RuCl3 ML, driven by structural symmetry-breaking.[121] While the spin 
direction in bulk α-RuCl3 is 35o away from the ab plane,[131] Yang et al. found that 
picoscale structural distortions in the α-RuCl3 monolayer alter the off-diagonal 
symmetric exchange interactions, leading to a reversal from in-plane to easy-axis 
magnetic anisotropy.[121] The profound influence of dimensionality and subtle lattice 
distortions on magnetic behavior of α-RuCl₃ films suggests that they may serve as 
model systems for probing the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, spin orbit 
coupling, and electron correlations in the quest for novel quantum states in vdW 
magnetic materials based on heavy transition metals. 

Page 22 of 73 
 
Based on experimental studies of various 2D vdW magnetic materials (see the 
summary in Table 1), it is evident that magnetic anisotropy is not only essential for 
stabilizing long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, but also plays a critical 
role in determining magnetic transition temperatures and enabling diverse 
functionalities. The rapid and ongoing expansion of this field continues to yield an 
increasing array of novel vdW magnetic materials and engineered heterostructures, 
which offer unprecedented opportunities to probe the interplay between magnetism, 
topology, and reduced dimensionality, opening pathways toward the realization of next-
generation spintronic, topological, and quantum devices. In this context, it is 
increasingly important to uncover the physical origins of magnetic anisotropy across 
different material platforms and to develop effective strategies for its precise control 
and manipulation, which are essential for advancing future applications in spintronics 
and quantum information technologies. 
3. Mechanisms of Magnetic Anisotropy in 2D vdW Magnets 
In this section, we review the underlying mechanisms responsible for magnetic 
anisotropy in 2D vdW magnets. While it is widely recognized that spin–orbit coupling 
plays a central role in determining magnetic anisotropy, a detailed understanding of 
how SOC influences anisotropic magnetic behavior in 2D vdW systems remains 
essential. Clarifying this connection not only deepens our insight into the origin of 
magnetic anisotropies at the atomic scale but also informs the design and control of 
emergent magnetic phenomena in low-dimensional materials. 
3.1 Magnetic Anisotropy by Ligand SOC 
As one of the prototypical 2D vdW magnetic materials, CrI3 ML has attracted 
widespread interest following the experimental discovery of long-range 2D FM order, 
particularly with regard to strategies for enhancing its Curie temperature.[5] Through 
DFT calculations and spin model Hamiltonian simulations, Lado et al. investigated the 
origin of the magnetic anisotropy of CrI3 ML.[48] They identified the dominant source 
of magnetic anisotropy as anisotropic symmetric superexchange interactions, primarily 
mediated by the SOC of the iodine ligands. Their analysis further revealed that the 
single-ion anisotropy of the Cr local moments is minimal, suggesting that the magnetic 
behavior of CrI3 ML is better captured by an XXZ-type Hamiltonian rather than an 
Ising model.[48] Although their model simulations underestimated TC by 20% compared 
to the experimental value based on their results, this study highlighted the crucial role 
of ligand SOC in generating strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in CrI3 ML 
(Figure 6A). Kim et al. also examined the influence of p-orbital SOC on the magnetic 
anisotropy in CrI3, and independently arrived at an anisotropic XXZ spin Hamiltonian 

Page 23 of 73 
 
that accounts for the observed magnetic anisotropy.[132] The same conclusion has also 
been obtained by other first-principles studies. Yang et al. assigned the MAE mainly to 
contributions from iodine atoms, up to 0.71 meV/atom, [133] comparable to the MAE of 
metallic Fe atoms at the Fe/MgO interface.[134] Through detailed analysis of the density 
of states and orbital-resolved MAE within second-order perturbation theory, they 
identified that the dominant contribution arises from the difference in matrix elements 
between same spin py and px orbitals of iodine atoms (Figure 6B). In an independent 
first-principles investigation of the tunability of magnetic anisotropy in CrI3 ML, Kim 
et al. similarly concluded that the strong SOC of iodine atoms is the principal source of 
the observed MAE. [135] 
Given the strong SOC of iodine atoms, various forms of anisotropic exchange 
interactions have been proposed to account for the magnetic anisotropy observed in 
CrI3 ML. By calculating exchange coupling matrix and SIA parameters using first-
principles calculations, Xu et al. argued that the magnetic anisotropy of CrI3 ML is 
determined by the interplay between SIA and Kiteav-like interactions.[136] They 
demonstrated that both SIA and Kiteav-like interactions are induced by the strong SOC 
of the heavy iodine atoms. Expanding on this perspective, Stavropoulos et al. 
considered the effects of the slight trigonal distortion in the CrI6 octahedra, in 
conjunction with the strong ligand SOC, and derived a comprehensive spin model that 
includes bond-dependent Kitaev interactions, off-diagonal symmetric exchange terms 
(Γ and Γ′), and SIA, in addition to the conventional isotropic Heisenberg exchange. 
[137] Their results revealed that the FM Γ , Γ′ , and SIA terms all contribute 
cooperatively to the observed out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in CrI3 MLs.

  The importance of the strong ligand SOC from iodine atoms in governing the 
magnetic anisotropy of CrI3 is also substantiated, to some extent, by experimental 
evidence. By comparing the experimental Cr L2,3 X-ray magnetic circular dichroism 
(XMCD) spectra with theoretical simulations based on a hybridized ground state, Frisk 
et al. concluded that Cr-I bonds in bulk CrI3 have a strongly covalent character, 
suggesting significant hybridization between Cr d- and I p-orbitals.[139] Furthermore, 
Lee et al., through a combination of angle-dependent ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) 
measurements on high-quality CrI3 single crystals and a symmetry-based theoretical 
analysis, identified the bond-dependent Kitaev interaction as the dominant anisotropic 
exchange term, while also noting that the off-diagonal symmetric exchange (Γ) is 
relatively small but essential for opening the observed spin-wave gap.[140] 
Complementary magnetic spectroscopy experiments further revealed a sizable orbital 
magnetic moment associated with the iodine atoms, providing direct experimental 
evidence of their contribution to the magnetic anisotropy in CrI3.[141] Collectively, these 
findings support the growing consensus that the strong SOC of iodine ligands plays a 
central role in determining the nature and strength of magnetic anisotropy in CrI3.  
The attribution of magnetic anisotropy to contributions from the halogen ligands is 
further substantiated by comparative studies across the CrX₃ series (X = Cl, Br, I), 
which systematically highlight the role of ligand SOC strength. One interesting 
example is CrCl3 ML. Early first-principles studies[142, 143] predicted an out-of-plane 
magnetic easy axis for CrCl3 ML, contradicting to the experimentally observed in-plane 
ferromagnetism. [76] In a comprehensive DFT study, Xue et al.[144] calculated the SOC-
induced out-of-plane MCA energies for CrCl3, CrBr3 and Cr3I MLs to be 18, 157 and 
655 μ eV/Cr, respectively, reflecting the increasing SOC strength from Cl to I. 
Meanwhile, they evaluated the in-plane magnetic shape anisotropy arising from dipole–
dipole interactions, finding comparatively small values of 58, 47, and 37 μeV per Cr 
atom for CrCl3, CrBr3 and CrI3 MLs, respectively. Despite the overall weakness of 
dipolar interactions, their relative importance becomes apparent in CrCl3, where the 

Page 25 of 73 
 
weak ligand SOC leads to an MCA smaller than the MSA, resulting in net in-plane 
magnetic anisotropy as observed in experiments. [76] In contrast, CrI3 and CrBr3 MLs 
retain out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy due to the strong SOC of Br and I atoms. This 
study underscores that while ligand SOC primarily governs magnetic anisotropy in 
heavier halides, dipolar interactions may become decisive in 2D vdW magnets 
composed of lighter elements. Notably, Gudelli et al. independently reported consistent 
findings regarding the origin of magnetic anisotropy in CrI3 ML.[145] 
Although bromine has a weaker SOC than iodine, its SOC strength still exceeds that 
of chromium. As a result, the magnetic anisotropy in CrBr3 monolayers exhibits 
qualitative similarity to that of CrI3 monolayers.[133] However, several notable 
differences distinguish their magnetic anisotropy characteristics.[138] First, the MAE of 
CrI3 ML is about five times larger than that of CrBr3 ML (Figure 6C).[138] Second, CrBr3 
ML has a much smaller out-of-plane exchange anisotropy compared to CrI3 ML.[138] 
Third, the two materials respond differently to biaxial strain: the MAE of CrBr3 
increases under tensile strain and decreases under compressive strain, following a 
nearly linear trend, while CrI3 MLs shows an anomalous response, with MAE 
increasing under both compressive and tensile strain.[138] These contrasting behaviors 
highlight the subtle dependence of magnetic anisotropy on the SOC strength of ligand 
p orbitals and demonstrate how small changes in chemical composition can lead to 
significant variations in the magnetic properties of 2D vdW magnets.[138] 
The mechanism underlying magnetic anisotropy in Cr2Ge2Te2 appears to be less 
understood compared to that in CrX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) MLs. Experimental studies have 
consistently shown that Cr2Ge2Te2 exhibits weak out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in 
both bulk and few-layer forms.[73, 146, 147] From a mean-field perspective, the out-of-
plane SIA in bulk Cr2Ge2Te2 has been estimated to be approximately 0.02 meV per Cr 
atom, a value comparable to 0.05 meV/Cr obtained via DFT calculations with a 
Hubbard U = 0.5 eV.[73] However, using the same U parameter and a more 
comprehensive spin Hamiltonian, Xu et al. found that the SIA in Cr2Ge2Te2 ML favors 
in-plane magnetization.[136] They argued that the weak magnetic anisotropy of 
Cr2Ge2Te2 ML arise from a near-cancellation between SIA and anisotropic Kitaev-type 
A theoretical study by Wang et al., based on a minimal tight-binding model constructed 
from maximally localized Wannier functions, also supports the in-plane magnetic 
anisotropy in Cr2Ge2Te2.[148] They argued that the behavior of MAE primarily originates 
from the Te 5p orbitals, which play a crucial role in enhancing both the ferromagnetic 
exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions between Cr spins. By 
incorporating both MCA and MSA, Yang et al. performed DFT calculations showing 
that out-of-plane magnetization is favored in bilayer, trilayer, and bulk Cr2Ge2Te6, while 

Page 26 of 73 
 
monolayers favor in-plane magnetization. [149] This behavior arises because the 
relatively large in-plane MSA overweighs its MCA, a trend reminiscent of that observed 
in CrCl3. [144] Another DFT study also found in-plane anisotropy for the Cr2Ge2Te6 
monolayer.[150] Given the well-documented shortcomings of the DFT+U approach in 
accurately capturing the bandgap of bulk Cr2Ge2Te6, Menichetti et al. employed hybrid 
functional calculations and achieved good agreement with experimental bandgaps 
measured via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Their results 
underscore the critical role of nonlocal electron–electron interactions in governing the 
electronic properties of Cr2Ge2Te6.[151] As a result, they found an out-of-plane SIA in 
Cr2Ge2Te6 ML; however, its magnitude was smaller than the in-plane MSA, leading to 
a preference for in-plane magnetization. These studies collectively highlight that the 
competition between out-of-plane SIA and in-plane MSA is a common and critical 
factor in determining the magnetic easy axis in 2D vdW ferromagnets. 
  Since Te is positioned near iodine in the same row of the periodic table, it also has a 
very strong SOC. This prompts a natural question of whether the SOC of Te plays a 
comparable role in determining the magnetic anisotropy of Cr2Ge2Te6 like the case of 
CrI3. Indeed, Wang et al.[148] demonstrated that the Te 5p states are largely responsible 
for the magnetic anisotropy in Cr2Ge2Te6 ML. Using atomic- and orbital-resolved 
magnetic anisotropy analysis based on second-order perturbation theory, Liu et al. 
found that the MCA of Cr2Ge2Te6 ML primarily originates from the hybridized Te-py 
and Te-pz orbitals.[150] Interestingly, a first-principles study combined with machine 
learning unveiled that, across many 2D A2B2X6 materials, the strength of magnetic 
anisotropy is dominated by the nonmagnetic X-site chalcogen, while the magnetic A-
site transition metal contributes relatively little.[152] This emphasizes the crucial role of 
Cr-Te orbital hybridization in transferring the strong SOC of Te to the localized Cr d-
orbitals, thereby playing a key role in determining the magnetic anisotropy in Cr2Ge2Te6. 
Giving the rapid advancements in applying machine learning to DFT studies in 
materials sciences,[153] leveraging these techniques offers a promising avenue to unravel 
the mechanisms underlying magnetic anisotropies in 2D vdW magnetic materials.  
  Like Cr2Ge2Te6, the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in 1T-CrTe₂ monolayers is 
primarily attributed to the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of Te atoms. It is suggested 
that the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in 1T-CrTe2 ML is primarily attributed to the 
strong SOC of Te atoms. Through systematic DFT investigations of the structural, 
electronic, and magnetic properties of various CrTe2 phases, Liu et al. demonstrated 
that the magnetic anisotropy of 1T-CrTe2 ML stems from the SOC of the Te atoms 
combined with superexchange coupling between the Cr-3d and Te-5p orbitals.[154] An 
atom- and orbital-resolved analysis of the MAE, based on second order perturbation 

Page 27 of 73 
 
theory, further confirmed that the SOC of Te atoms is the dominant contributor to the 
MAE in 1T-CrTe2 ML.[155] Interestingly, the magnetic anisotropy arises from a delicate 
competition between positive contributions due to py/pz orbital hybridization and 
negative contribution from px/py hybridizations, enabling strain-induced tuning of the 
easy axis from out-of-plane to in-plane in 1T-CrTe2 ML.[155] Supporting this conclusion, 
two additional DFT studies also attributed the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in 1T-
CrTe2 ML chiefly to the strong SOC of Te atoms, which significantly exceeds that of 
Cr.[156, 157] 
  Ultrathin MnBi2Te4 and MnBi2Se4 films are topological vdW magnetic materials 
whose magnetic anisotropies are generally weak. This behavior is largely attributed to 
the nature of the Mn2+ magnetic ion, which has a half-filled 3d shell. DFT calculations 
by Li et al. found that MnBi2Te4 ML has nearly isotopic exchange interactions, as a 
result of the weak p-d hybridization between Mn and Te atoms.[158] The SIA of 
MnBi2Te4 ML cannot be explained solely by the SOC of Mn atoms. Instead, it involves 
the SOC of the ligand Te atoms, which alters the local Mn 3d electronic states and 
contributes to the observed anisotropy. It is worth noting that although Bi atoms possess 
strong SOC, their contribution to the magnetic anisotropy is minimal. [158] Instead, Bi 
atoms play a crucial role in mediating the FM exchange interactions in MnBi2Te4 
ML.[159] 
  Although MnPS3 and MnPSe3 are isostructural and have similar magnetic moments, 
critical temperatures and share the same AFM ordering, they exhibit markedly different 
magnetic anisotropies.[160, 161] Early experimental measurements indicated that MnPS3 
has a weak out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy arising from a competition between SIA 
and MSA.[162, 163] More recent investigations into the system’s critical behavior across 
a wide temperature range revealed a crossover from an isotropic Heisenberg AFM state 
at high temperatures to a 2D XY phase at temperatures.[164-167] This intriguing spin-
related critical transition in MnPS3 remains an interesting open question in the field. 
Theoretically, DFT calculations consistently show that MnPS3 is well characterized by 
isotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions and possesses only very small SIA.[168-170] 
In contrast, MnPSe3 exhibits unusually large XY anisotropy.[161] Given that Mn2+ ions 
in their high spin 6S ground state typically show minimal zero-field splitting, the zero-
field splitting for the orbital singlet of Mn2+ ions is usually small, the substantial in-
plane anisotropy in MnPSe3 has been attributed to the stronger ligand SOC of the 
heavier Se atoms compared to S in MnPS3.[161] Analysis of zero-wavevector magnon 
excitations by Jana et al. indicated that the spins in MnPSe3 align along specific in-
plane crystal axes, though these axes remain experimentally undetermined and merit 
further study.[171] Supporting these observations, DFT calculations confirmed that SOC 

Page 28 of 73 
 
induces in-plane magnetic anisotropy in MnPSe3 monolayer.[172] Furthermore, 
chalcogen substitution in MnPS3-xSex (0≤x≤3) has been shown to effectively tune the 
magnetic anisotropy between out-of-plane and in-plane orientations. This tunability is 
primarily attributed to the enhanced SIA arising from the increasing ligand SOC 
contribution as Se content increases.[169]  
CrSBr features an orthorhombic crystal structure and exhibits a triaxial magnetic 
anisotropy; explicitly, its easy, intermediate, and hard magnetic axes are along the 
crystallographic b, a, and c axes, respectively.[173] A This distinct anisotropy has been 
experimentally confirmed via second harmonic generation measurements, which 
indicated that the magnetic order in CrSBr bilayers follows the anisotropic Heisenberg 
model, rather than the Ising or XY paradigms.[77] DFT studies have revealed that the 
triaxial magnetic anisotropy of CrSBr originates from the combined effects of MCA 
and MSA.[174, 175] A detailed investigation of Heisenberg exchange interactions and SIA 
by Wang et al. revealed that the exchange interactions are nearly isotropic, while the 
SOC of the ligand Br atom plays a dominant role in determining the SIA. In contrast, 
the SOC contributions from Cr and S atoms were found to be negligible when 
considered individually. Notably, when the SOC effects of both Br and Cr are taken into 
account simultaneously, the resulting SIA values closely match those observed 
experimentally, suggesting that the magnetic anisotropy is primarily governed by the 
strong SOC of the heavier ligand Br atoms, modulated by their hybridization with the 
Cr 3d states. 
3.2 Magnetic Anisotropy and Unquenched Orbital Magnetic Moments 
In magnetic materials, both magnetic anisotropy and unquenched orbital magnetic 
moments arise from SOC, and these two quantities are often interrelated. For instance, 
although VI3 MLs and CrI3 MLs are both 2D ferromagnets with honeycomb lattice 
coordinated by iodine atoms, the underlying electronic structures of their magnetic ions 
differ significantly. In CrI3, the Cr3+ ion adopts a 3d3 configuration with a closed 𝑡𝑡2𝑔𝑔
3   
shell in an octahedral crystal field, resulting in a high-spin state with S = 3/2 and 
negligible orbital angular momentum due to orbital quenching. In contrast, in VI3, the 
V3+ ion has a 3d2 configuration with a partially filled 𝑡𝑡2𝑔𝑔
2  shell, yielding an S = 1 state 
and a greater susceptibility to unquenched orbital contributions. This difference in 3d 
shells occupancy implies that the origin of magnetic anisotropy inVI3 ML is different 
from that in CrI3 ML, despite both systems exhibiting strong out-of-plane magnetic 
anisotropy. Using the DFT+U approach, Wang et al. reported that the out-of-plane 
MAE of VI3 ML varies from 0.05 to 0.4 meV, depending on the value of the Hubbard 

Page 29 of 73 
 
U parameter used.[177] The U-dependence arise from the fact that the band gap of VI3 
ML increases with increasing U, which in turn affects the SOC–induced splittings 
relevant to MAE.[177] In a separate study, Subhan et al. obtained has an out-of-plane 
MAE of 0.29 meV/cell for VI3 ML.[178] Their atom-resolved analysis revealed that both 
vanadium atoms contribute equally to the anisotropy, with a MAE of approximately 
0.15 meV per atom.[178] While both studies consistently predict an out-of-plane easy 
axis, the computed MAE values are significantly lower than the experimentally inferred 
value of about 1.16 meV, derived from helicity-resolved Raman spectroscopy 
measurements of the spin-wave gap.[179] Given that the open 3d shell of V3+ ions, Yang 
et al. investigated the magnetic anisotropy of VI3 ML by combining DFT calculations 
with crystal field level analyses.[180] Their results reveal that when the magnetization is 
oriented out-of-plane, the orbital magnetic moment per V ion can reach approximately  
1.0 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵 /V, aligned antiparallel to the spin moment. In contrast, with in-plane 
magnetization, the orbital moment is significantly reduced to about 0.15 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵 per V ion. 
As a result of such large orbital magnetic moment of V3+ ions, the out-of-plane SIA and 
exchange anisotropy in VI3 ML are calculated to be 15.9 and 0.67 meV, respectively.[180] 
Based on DFT calculations which employ the hybrid functional (HSE06) method of 
considering exact exchange, Zhao et al. obtained that the orbital magnetic moment in 
VI3 ML is about 1.0 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵 /V for all magnetizations orientations.[181] This strong 
anisotropy in orbital magnetization leads to a pronounced out-of-plane SIA and 
exchange anisotropy, calculated to be 15.9 meV and 0.67 meV, respectively. [180] In a 
separate study, Zhao et al. [181] employed hybrid functional, which incorporates a 
portion of exact exchange, to examine the same system. Their calculations also predict 
an orbital magnetic moment of approximately 1.0 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵/V per V ion; however, in contrast 
to Yang et al., this value is nearly independent of magnetization direction and their SIA 
is also low, 7.58 meV. The discrepancy is not unusual as the band splittings depend on 
the electron correlation and exchange effects.   
It worth noting that although the MAEs reported by Yang[180] and Zhao[181] are 
significantly larger than the experimentally one,[178] their calculated orbital magnetic 
moments are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurement of 
approximately 0.6 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵/V.[182] In fact, two additional DFT calculations[183, 184] have also 
predicted the presence of large orbital magnetic moments in VI3 ML, further reinforcing 
the idea that unquenched orbital angular momentum plays a central role in the 
magnetism of this material. Sandratskii et al.[184] further demonstrated that the anti-
dimerization distortion of crystal structure significantly influences the orientation of the 
magnetic easy axis in bulk VI3 [87]. On the other hand, VI3 ML shares key structural 
characteristics with CrI3 ML, including a honeycomb lattice and iodine ligand 
environment. Hence, the bond-dependent Kitaev interactions and off-diagonal 

Page 30 of 73 
 
symmetry exchange couplings Γ and Γ′, known to be relevant in CrI3, could also play 
a non-negligible role in shaping the magnetic anisotropy of VI3 ML. 
The Ising-type 2D antiferromagnetism observed in FePS3 ML has been closely linked 
to the presence of unquenched orbital magnetic moments on the Fe2+ ions. Based on a 
comprehensive magnetic model incorporating an exceptionally large number of 
parameters derived from DFT calculations, Kim et al. pointed out the crucial role of 
orbital degrees of freedom in enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of FePS3.[185] 
Supporting this picture, Amirabbasi et al. reported orbital ordering and a sizable orbital 
magnetic moment of about 0.8 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵 per Fe atom in FePS3 ML.[186] Further insights come 
from DFT calculations combined with crystal field level diagrams, which show that 
SOC induces a splitting of the half-filled minority-spin 𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔
𝜋𝜋 doublet in high-spin Fe2+, 
resulting in an orbital magnetic moment of 0.76 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵/Fe and FePS3 ML and a remarkably 
large out-of-plane SIA energy of 19.4 meV.[187] These theoretical predictions are in good 
agreement with experimental findings: simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
based on ligand field multiplet theory reveal an even larger orbital magnetic moment 
of 1.02 ± 0.04 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵/Fe and an exceptionally large out-of-plane MAE of 22 meV/Fe.[60] 
Physically, this giant MAE is attributed to the spin–orbit entangled nature of the 𝑎𝑎1𝑔𝑔 
and 𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔
𝜋𝜋 states of the Fe2+ ions (Figure 6D). Atomic orbital-resolved MCA calculations 
further confirm that the Fe atoms are the dominant contributors to the MAE in FePS3 
ML.[188, 189] 
Magnetic anisotropies associated with unquenched orbital magnetic moments are 
also important in Kitaev magnetic materials, a class of spin-orbit assisted Mott 
insulators characterized by spin-orbit entangled Jeff = 1/2 states.[44] These Jeff = 1/2 states, 
characterized by substantial unquenched orbital magnetic moments, give rise to 
strongly anisotropic bond-dependent Kitaev and off-diagonal symmetric exchange 
interactions. As already mentioned above, α-RuCl3 is a peculiarly compelling platform 
for investigating 2D quantum magnetism and proximity to a quantum spin liquid state. 
The pronounced magnetic anisotropy observed in α-RuCl3 has been widely attributed 
to the presence of a sizable off-diagonal symmetric exchange interaction Γ . Early 
theoretical studies examining g-factor suggested that FM Kitaev interactions with 
relatively small off-diagonal symmetric exchange Γ  and Γ′  could reproduce the 
observed magnetic anisotropy in α-RuCl3. In contrast, for AFM Kitaev scenarios, a 
significantly larges and negative Γ coupling was required.[190] DFT calculations by 
Hou et al., which explicitly constrained the direction of orbital magnetic moments, 
further emphasize that the nearest neighbor off-diagonal symmetric exchange Γ plays 
a pivotal role in determining the preferred direction of magnetic moments in α-
RuCl3.[191] This theoretical insight was subsequently corroborated by resonant elastic 

Page 31 of 73 
 
X-ray scattering experiments, which demonstrated that a large Γ along can account for 
the observed magnetic anisotropy in α-RuCl3.[192] Physically, the off-diagonal 
symmetric exchange Γ effectively exerts a directional torque on the spin-orbital 
moments, energetically favoring spin alignment within the ab plane. This anisotropic 
exchange mechanism not only governs static magnetic anisotropy but also significantly 
influences the low-energy spin dynamics, thereby playing a central role in the complex 
magnetic behavior of α-RuCl3. 
It is valuable to compare magnetic anisotropies arising from ligand SOC with those 
driven by unquenched orbital magnetic moments on magnetic ions. Fundamentally, 
both mechanisms originate from SOC, and the distinction between them appears to be 
somewhat interpretive, serving primarily as a conceptual framework to aid physical 
understanding. Nevertheless, this classification proves useful when examining trends 
across different materials. In the case of CrX3 compound, magnetic anisotropy is mainly 
related to ligand SOC. As a result, the MAE in CrX3 can be turned across a wide range 
by halogen substitution, e.g., from out-of-plane MAE with iodine to in-plane MAE with 
chlorine. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy in VI3 is largely determined by the 
unquenched orbital magnetic moment on V3- ions. Consequently, substituting the ligand 
atoms in VI₃ with lighter halogens such as Br or Cl has limited impact on its magnetic 
anisotropy. This is supported by experimental observations, e.g., VBr3 retains an out-
of-plane magnetic moment alignment. [193] AFM VCl3 ML grown on NbSe2 substrate, 
which breaks both C₃ rotational and inversion symmetries, exhibits an xz magnetic easy 
plane,[194] differing from the xy plane seen in CrCl3 ML.[76] Therefore, the division 
between ligand-driven and ion-driven anisotropy is useful especially when devising 
strategies to manipulate and enhance magnetic anisotropy in 2D vdW magnets through 
targeted chemical substitutions. 
3.3 Fe-based 2D itinerant ferromagnets 
Due to its relatively high Curie temperature, Fe3GeTe2 ML is a promising candidate 
for spintronic applications and has attracted significant research interest. As a metallic 
ferromagnet, its magnetization originates from a Stoner instability, primarily involving 
the dxy and 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥2−𝑦𝑦2 orbitals of Fe atoms near the Fermi level.[103] DFT calculations by 
Zhuang et al. found that Fe atoms in Fe3GeTe2 ML have an average orbital magnetic 
moment of about 0.1 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵
[103] and the out-of-plane MCA energy is 0.92 meV/Fe. The in-
plane MSA energy is negligible, only 36 μeV/Fe. Further insights into the origin of 
magnetic anisotropy were provided by Liu et al., who analyzed the SOC matrix 
elements near the Fermi level. They showed that the positive (out-of-plane) 
contributions to MAE of Fe3GeTe2 mainly originate from SOC interaction across the 

Page 32 of 73 
 
unoccupied 𝑑𝑑3𝑧𝑧2−𝑟𝑟2 orbitals and half-occupied dxz/dyz orbitals of Fe3+ ions. Conversely, 
the same orbital pairs in Fe2+ ions give a negative (in-plane) contribution to MAE.[195] 
Their calculations yielded a total MAE of approximately 0.94 meV/Fe, consistent with 
previous DFT results.[103] Momentum-space resolved analysis by Park et al. 
demonstrated that the primary contributions to the out-of-plane MAE originate from 
electronic states along the K–H high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone.[196]  
As shown in Figure 7B, the strong SOC of ligand Te atoms was identified to play a 
dominant role in producing out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in Fe3GeTe2. Wang et al. 
systematically examined the atom-specific SOC contributions to the MAE and found 
that the majority of the anisotropy arises from Te atoms, despite their weak induced 
magnetization from neighboring Fe atoms.[197] Notably, turning off the SOC on Fe 
atoms has a negligible impact on the MAE, while eliminating SOC on Te atoms 
dramatically reduces the MAE to 0.2 meV/Fe, underscoring their dominant role.[198] 
Furthermore, the strong contribution from Te is attributed to SOC-induced mixing 
between its px and py orbitals near the Fermi level, as well as to the presence of a 
topological nodal point just below the Fermi level at the K points in the Brillouin 
zone.[199] 
Experimentally, a field-dependent anisotropic magnetic coupling has been observed 
in Fe3−xGeTe2 (x ≈ 0.28),[200] suggesting a possible connection between the material’s 
magnetic anisotropy and anisotropic exchange interactions. DFT calculations for 
Fe3GeTe2 have revealed that the nearest-neighbor exchange anisotropy,

is approximately 0.2 meV/𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵

  Fe3GeTe2 exhibits an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy that is about a three times 
larger than that of Fe4GeTe2.[105] To elucidate the electronic origins underlying this stark 
contrast in magnetic anisotropy, chemical bonding and Coulomb screening of Fe3GeTe2 
and Fe4GeTe2 are examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.[203] 
The analysis revealed that the Fe dumbbell structures in Fe3GeTe2 result in 𝑑𝑑3𝑧𝑧2−𝑟𝑟2 
bonding and antibonding states, which are effectively split from the t2g manifold. In 
contrast, Fe atoms in Fe4GeTe2 form bonds among themselves with more symmetric 
electronic structure. As a result, the Coulomb interaction is more effectively screened 
in Fe4GeTe2 than Fe3GeTe2, according to X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT 
data.[203] 
  Unlike Fe3GeTe2 and Fe4GeTe2, Fe5GeTe2 has a unique structural feature: the Fe1 
atoms have two equally probable sites with partial occupancy.[106, 112, 204, 205] As a result, 
Ge sites are also split (see the right panel in Figure 7C).[106, 112, 116] A high-brilliance 
laboratory X-ray experiment further revealed that Fe5GeTe2 has a long-range ordered 
√3 × √3-R30o superstructure, a minority phase associated with ordered Te vacancies. 
This superstructure is inherently two-dimensional, lacking lattice periodicity 
perpendicular to the vdW layers.[206] Ershadrad et al. modeled Fe5GeTe2 ML using two 
representative Fe1 configurations (see the left panel in Figure 7C).[201] Their DFT 
calculations showed that Fe5GeTe2 ML has a weak out-of-plane MAE of 0.021 meV/Fe 
in a UDU configuration. For the UUU configuration, they obtained an in-plane MAE 
of 0.112 meV/Fe. These results are consistent with the sample-dependent magnetic 
anisotropies observed experimentally in various studies..[111-115] Using DUU 
configuration, which is considered more energetically favorable, [207] Hu et al. also 
found an in-plane magnetic anisotropy in Fe5GeTe2 ML based on DFT calculations.[208] 
Notably, they attributed a major role to the Te’s SOC. On the experimental side, a 
comparison between measured critical exponents and theoretical predictions from 
various magnetic exchange models suggests an enhancement of anisotropic exchange 
below the Curie temperature in Fe5GeTe2.[209] However, broadband FM resonance 
spectroscopy of bulk single-crystal near TC indicates that anisotropic symmetric 
exchange is negligible, if present at all.[210] X-ray and electron microscopy studies by 
Birch et al. suggested that the ordering of the Fe1 sublattice may alter the out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy in Fe5GeTe2.[211] To fully elucidate the origins and behavior of 
magnetic anisotropy in Fe5GeTe2, additional in-depth experimental and theoretical 
studies are still needed.

  DFT studies have shown that Fe3GaTe2 ML, which is isostructural to Fe3GeTe2, has 
an out-of-plane MAE of 0.31 meV/Fe.[212] An atom-resolved analysis further revealed 
that the out-of-plane SIA is Fe3GaTe2 ML reaches 0.69 meV/Fe, with dominant 
contributions from Fe and Te atoms (Figure 7D).[202] However, a separate DFT study 
by Xi et al. reported that the nearest neighbor exchange anisotropy

 in 
Fe3GaTe2 is as large as 3.2 meV/𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵
2, which is much larger than the rescaled SIA (0.05 
meV/𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵
2).[118] This contrast suggests that the strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in 
Fe3GaTe2 originates predominantly from Ising-type exchange anisotropy, rather than 
from SIA. This result suggested that the strong out-of-plane magnetic antitropy of 
Fe3GaTe2 originates almost from the strong Ising-type exchange anisotropy. Supporting 
this theoretical insight, critical exponent measurements indicate that Fe3GaTe2 behaves 
as a vdW ferromagnet governed by a 3D Ising model with long-range interactions.[213]  
4. Impact of Magnetic Anisotropy on Electronic Properties in 2D vdW Magnets  
Beyond determining the magnetic orientation and phase transitions of 2D vdW 
magnets, magnetic anisotropy serves as a powerful tuning parameter for modulating 
their electronic and topological properties. By constructing 2D vdW heterostructures 
that combine magnetic layers with other functional materials, novel quantum 
phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, axion insulator phases, and 
valley polarization, can be realized through the magnetic proximity effect. Moreover, 
the properties of 2D vdW magnetic heterostructures can be further engineered through 
layer stacking, elemental substitution, doping, and strain application, offering rich 
opportunities to achieve diverse topological spin textures and enhanced Curie 
temperatures, both critical for the development of practical spintronic, valleytronic, 
topotronic, and quantum devices. As discussed below, magnetic anisotropy plays a 
pivotal role in enabling and controlling these emergent phenomena in 2D vdW magnetic 
heterostructures. 
4.1 Spin-orientation-dependent electronic properties in 2D vdW magnets  
Since the SOC Hamiltonian term 𝜉𝜉𝑳𝑳∙𝑺𝑺  depends on the spin orientation, the 
electronic band structure may display a change when the spin orientation is adjusted by 
an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is called a magneto-band-structure (MB) 
effect.[13] Such effect is illustrated by a 2D three-p-orbital (px, py, and pz) toy model as 
shown in Figure 8A.[13] Interestingly, CrI3 ML is demonstrated by a DFT calculation 
study to show a giant MB effect (Figure 8B).[13] When switching its spin magnetic 
moment from out-of-plane to in-plane, CrI3 ML experiences a direct-to-indirect 
bandgap transition which can be observed by measuring the photoluminescence. 

Page 35 of 73 
 
Additionally, doped CrI3 ML shows a significantly changed Fermi surface with 
different spin magnetic moment orientations (Figure 8C), which can achieve giant 
anisotropic magnetoresistance.[13] Finally, an novel topological phase transition from a 
single-spin Dirac semimetal to a Chern topological insulator can be realized in electron 
doped CrI3 ML.[13]

Similar to CrI3 ML, spin orientations play a vital role in determining the topological 
properties of Fe3GeTe2. As shown in Figure 7D, a nodal point appears below the Fermi 
level at the K point in the spin-polarized band structure of bulk Fe3GeTe2, as calculated 
by DFT. [214] This nodal point extends along the K-H line, forming a topological nodal 
line protected by C3z and 𝐶𝐶̃6𝑧𝑧My symmetries.[214] When SOC is included and the spin 
orientation is set to out-of-plane in DFT calculations, this topological nodal line is 
gapped, leading to emergence of large Berry curvature near the gapped region (middle 
and bottom panels in Figure 8D). Experimentally, this gapping manifests as a large 

Page 36 of 73 
 
anomalous Hall current observed in Fe3GeTe2 crystals, providing evidence for the 
topological nature of the electronic states.[214] In contrast, when the spin orientation is 
in-plane, the nodal line remains gapless, preserving the topological line degeneracy. [199]   
Fe4GeTe2 exhibits a temperature-driven spin reorientation transition,[100, 105, 108, 109] 
therefore, it is a natural playground to explore the effect of spin orientations on 
magneto-transport and topological properties. By studying various transport properties 
like the ordinary Hall effect, resistivity, magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall 
conductivity, it is suggested that the resistivity of a Fe4GeTe2 nanoflake is governed by 
the electron-electron scattering, inelastic scattering contributions, electron-magnon and 
electron-phonon when it has an out-of-plane spin orientation.[15] When the Fe4GeTe2 
nanoflake has an in-plane spin orientation, its resistivity is dominated by the electron-
phonon scattering.[15] Interestingly, it is even reported that, in a Fe4GeTe2/Fe4GeTe2 
homojunction, the temperature-dependent magnetoresistance is negative when its spin 
orientation is in-plane but positive when its spin orientation is out-of-plane.[14] Besides, 
Bera et al. observed an anomalous Hall effect which is induced by Berry curvatures in 
Fe4GeTe2 when its spin orientation is along the out-of-plane magnetic easy axis.[216] 
They further showed based on DFT calculations that the anomalous Hall conductivity 
of Fe4GeTe2 decreases with its spin orientation being rotated from the out-of-plane z-
axis towards the in-plane x-axis, eventually reaching zero when its spin orientation is 
along the x-axis. All these findings indicate that the magneto-transport and topological 
properties of Fe4GeTe2 are dependent on its flexible spin orientations, which lies an 
important foundation for its potential to explore novel spintronic devices. 
Another important consequence of tuning magnetic anisotropy is the ability to 
stabilize and manipulate complex spin textures in real space, such as magnetic 
skyrmions, chiral domain walls, spin spirals, and merons, in 2D vdW magnetic 
materials. The emergence and stability of these textures depend sensitively on the 
interplay 
among 
Heisenberg 
exchange 
interactions, 
magnetic 
anisotropy, 
Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions, and Zeeman energy.[9] Angle-dependent magneto-
transport measurements on Fe4GeTe2 single crystals[215] have revealed that a large 
topological Hall effect in multilayer samples, attributed to spin reorientation transitions 
that give rise to non-coplanar spin textures. As shown in Figure 8E, this topological 
Hall effect persists throughout the entire temperature range from TSRT down to the 
lowest measured temperature when the magnetic field is applied within the ab-plane 
(B||ab). In contrast, when the field is aligned along the c-axis (B||c), the topological 
Hall effect appears only within a narrower temperature window below 30 K. Of 
particular interest is the experimental observation of coexistence of merons and 
magnetic skyrmions in Fe5-xGeTe2, as demonstrated by Casas et al. [217] This behavior 

Page 37 of 73 
 
arises from the weak and Fe-deficiency-dependent MCA in Fe5-xGeTe2. In regions with 
out-of-plane anisotropy, skyrmions are stabilized, whereas merons are found in 
domains characterized by in-plane anisotropy.[217]  
4.2 Heterostructures of Topological and 2D vdW magnetic Materials 
Inducing long-range spin polarization into topological materials is an attractive 
strategy for realizing exotic quantum phases, such as QAHE and axion insulator state, 
which host robust, dissipationless edge currents and topologically quantized 
magnetoelectric coupling.[16] While conventional approaches include doping 
topological materials with 3d transition metal elements [218] or interfacing them with 
non-vdW magnetic materials,[219] a particularly appealing alternative is the construction 
of heterostructures combining 2D vdW magnetic materials with topological insulators. 
This approach leverages the mechanical flexibility, clean interfaces, and tunability of 
vdW heterostructures, offering a versatile platform for exploring proximity-induced 
topological magnetism and quantum transport phenomena.[220]  
  By co-depositing Mn and Se onto the surface of the 3D TI, Bi2Se3, Hirahara et al. 
fabricated a self-assembled MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 heterostructure (Figure 9A).[221] Their 
experimental studies revealed that this heterostructure exhibits robust ferromagnetism 
with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, persisting up to room temperature. More 
remarkably, ARPES measurements showed a clear Dirac gap opening of approximately 
100 meV, while the rest of the band structure remains largely intact (Figures 9B–9C). 
Complementary DFT calculations confirmed that MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3/MnBi2Se4 
possesses a nontrivial Chern number of CN = -1, identifying the system as a quantum 
anomalous Hall phase.  
    Using MBE, Rienks et al. reported the formation of a vdW MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 
heterostructure by growing Mn-doped Bi2Te3 on suitable substrates. This 
heterostructure features a self-organized alternating sequence of MnBi2Te4 septuple 
layers (SLs) and Bi2Te3 quintuple layers (QLs) (Figure 9D).[222] Interestingly, similar 
layered heterostructures were also observed in Mn-doped Bi2Se3 and Mn-doped Sb2Te3, 
resulting in MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 and MnSb2Te4/Sb2Te3, respectively. DFT calculations 
indicated that both MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 and MnSb2Te4/Sb2Te3 structures have out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy, whereas MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 has an in-plane anisotropy due to its 
relatively weaker SOC. As a result, ARPES measurements showed that 
MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 hosts a sizable magnetic gap of 90±10 meV at the Dirac point (Figure 
9E-9G), while MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 only exhibits a nonmagnetic gap at its Dirac point. This 
contrasting behavior underscores the critical role of magnetic anisotropy in realizing 
nontrivial band topology in heterostructures that combine 2D vdW magnetic materials 

Page 38 of 73 
 
with 3D TIs. Since MnSb2Te4/Sb2Te3 is p-type with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy 
and a magnetic Dirac gap while MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 is n-type, alloying to form 
Mn(Bi,Sb)2Te4/Bi2Te3 enables band and anisotropy engineering within a single 
heterostructure, offering an appealing route toward achieving robust edge-state 
transport in QAHE devices.

  A large anomalous Hall effect has been experimentally observed in a heterostructure 
composed of 2D vdW FM insulator, Cr2Ge2Te6, and a thin film of 3D TI, (Bi,Sb)2Te3.[223] 
Using MBE, Mogi et al. fabricated a Cr2Ge2Te6/(Bi,Sb)2Te3/Cr2Ge2Te6 heterostructure 
(Figure 9H)[223] and found that it exhibits out-of-plane ferromagnetism with a  
anomalous Hall conductivity as high as 0.2 e2/h (Figure 9I), despite the weak 
magnetization in the TI layers. This indicates that out-of-plane magnetization of 
Cr2Ge2Te6 can effectively magnetize the topological surface states of (Bi,Sb)2Te3 
through the magnetic proximity effect, thereby opening a sizable exchange gap and 
inducing anomalous Hall conductivity (Figure 9J). The Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene 
heterostructure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial 
topological phases and magnetic proximity effects, both theoretically and 
experimentally. Using DFT calculations, Zhang et al. predicted that an out-of-plane 
magnetization induced QAHE in this vdW heterostructure.[224] Importantly, their 
calculations showed that the QAHE is robust against variations in the stacking 
configuration between graphene and Cr2Ge2Te6, and that the Fermi level lies precisely 
within the nontrivial band gap, ensuring the quantized Hall conductance. 
Experimentally, Yao et al.[225] also observed the anomalous Hall effect in 
Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene. Complementary spin precession measurements by Yang et al. 
revealed that graphene in this heterostructure acquires appreciable spin polarization and 
SOC from Cr2Ge2Te6,[226] enabling the anomalous Hall effect for the use in seamless, 
gate-tunable spintronic devices. 
By combining DFT calculations with a four-band model Hamiltonian simulations, 
Hou et al. investigated the potential for realizing QAHE in vdW heterostructure 
composed of Bi2Se3 and CrI3 (Figure 10A).[227] They demonstrated that out-of-plane 
magnetization of the FM CrI3 ML effectively magnetizes the topological surface states 
of Bi2Se3 films and creates a sizable spin splitting at the Dirac point (Figure 10B). By 

Page 40 of 73 
 
varying the thickness of 3D TI Bi2Se3 films, they found that the CrI3/Bi2Se3/CrI3 
heterostructure can support QAHE at a temperature of a few tens of Kelvins when the 
Bi2Se3 film exceeds 5 QLs in thickness (Figure 10C). By embedding a CrI3 ML within 
Bi2Se3, Chen et al. showed that the topologically nontrivial gap can be enlarged, up to 
30 meV, in the multilayer structure Bi2Se3/CrI3/Bi2Se3/CrI3/Bi2Se3.[228] It is worth 
noting that further increasing the thickness of CrI3 in CrI3/Bi2Se3 heterostructures is 
unlikely to enhance the proximity-induced Dirac gap. This limitation arises from two 
key factors: (1) the spatial extent of the topological surface states in Bi₂Se₃ is inherently 
confined, restricting effective exchange coupling to only the nearest CrI₃ layers; and (2) 
CrI₃ exhibits AFM interlayer ordering in its multilayer form.[5] In a comparable case, it 
has been shown than shown that the FM MnBi2Se4 ML produces a larger Dirac gap in 
the MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 heterostructure than the AFM Mn2Bi2Se5 layer[229, 
230] 
Additionally, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the FM CrI3 ML can induce a very large 
magnetic exchange field (about 150 meV) in graphene within a CrI3/graphene 
heterostructure, providing that the CrI3-graphene interlayer distance is reduced from 
3.3 Å to 2.4 Å through external compression[231].  
The vdW heterostructure of 2D TI Bi bilayer and FM MnBi2Te4 ML is of high interest 
for examining the close relationship between magnetic anisotropy and QAHE.[11] Note 
that the lattice constants of Bi bilayer and MnBi2Te4 ML are well matched which is 
advantageous for experimental synthesis of Bi/MnBi2Te4 vdW heterostructure (Figure 
10D). DFT calculations show that Bi/MnBi2Te4 has an in-plane magnetic easy, i.e., in-
plane magnetic anisotropy and the energy barrier of spin rotation within the x-y plane 
is negligibly small. Considering the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of Bi/MnBi2Te4, band 
structures and edges state study indicated that this heterostructure can realize an-plane 
magnetization induced QAHE with a Chern number of CN = +1 in this heterostructure 
when aligning its magnetization along the x axis (Figure 10E). When its magnetization 
is rotated by 𝛷𝛷 = 60o with respect to the x axis, Bi/MnBi2Te4 exhibits a QAHE with 
Chern number of CN = +1. As a result of the spin rotation within the x-y plane, the Chern 
number of Bi/MnBi2Te4 oscillates between +1 and -1 with an interval of 60o (Figure 
10F), consistent with the crystal symmetry of Bi/MnBi2Te4. When its magnetization is 
aligned along the out-of-plane direction which can be realized by applying an external 
magnetic field, strain, or twisting, Bi/MnBi2Te4 surprisingly displays a QAHE with 
high Chern numbers of CN = ±3. Therefore, the QAHE in Bi/MnBi2Te4 is dictated 
unambiguously by its magnetic anisotropy. Note that an in-plane magnetization induced 
QAHE is also theoretically predicted in other 2D vdW magnetic materials, such as LaCl, 
NiAsO3 and PbSbO3 MLs.[232, 233]  
An axion insulator phase in vdW heterostructures of 2D magnetic insulators and 3D 

Page 41 of 73 
 
TI thin films is also a topological quantum state which arises from the interplay between 
the out-of-plane magnetization of the former and the topological surface state of the 
latter. It has been experimentally reported in conventional FM/TI/FM heterostructures 
whose two FM materials has different coercive fields (Hc).[234, 235] Given the narrow 
external magnetic field range for the appearance of the axion insulator phase in the 
FM/TI/FM heterostructures, a FM/TI/AFM heterostructure of 3D TI thin films and 2D 
vdW magnetic materials is put forward to realize the axion insulator phase in a wide 
external magnetic field range (Figure 10H). The core of realizing axion insulator phase 
in such heterostructure is still magnetizing the topological surface states of 3D TI thin 
films with the out-of-plane magnetizations of 2D vdW FM and AFM materials. Inspired 
by the experimentally synthesized FM MnBi2Se4,[221] the AFM Mn2Bi2Se5 ML with an 
out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy is predicted and MBi2Se4/Bi2Se3/Mn2Bi2Se5 is 
theoretically proposed to achieve the axion insulator phase.[230] The DFT calculated 
band structures and surface-projected Berry curvatures (Figure 10I-10K) indicate that 
the top and bottom surfaces of MBi2Se4/Bi2Se3/Mn2Bi2Se5 have opposite half-quantum 
Hall conductance, i.e., 𝜎𝜎𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
𝑡𝑡= e2/2h and 𝜎𝜎𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥
𝑏𝑏= -e2/2h. So, FM/TI/AFM heterostructures 
with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy are feasible to realize the axion insulator. 
Ferromagnetically ordered heterostructures of 2D vdW magnetic materials and 3D 
TI thin films is also suggested to achieve the axion insulator phase in a high magnetic 
field, which facilitates the experimental detections of the topological magnetoelectric 
effect.[236] The underlying mechanism for the existence of the axion insulator phase in 
such heterostructures is that the out-of-plane FM magnetizations of the two different 
2D vdW magnetic materials introduce opposite exchange fields into the topological 
surface state of 3D TI thin films. As a result of the opposite exchange fields, such 
heterostructure can give rise to the opposite half-quantum Hall conductance at its two 
surfaces, namely, the axion insulator state, in a ferromagnetically ordered magnetization. 
A theoretical investigation based on DFT calculations and a four-band model suggested 
that the ferromagnetically order heterostructure CrI3/Bi2Se3/MnBi2Se4 indeed hosts the 
axion insulator phase.[236]

4.3 Valley Physics and Magnetic Skyrmions in 2D vdW Magnetic Heterostructures 
Valley semiconductors, such as MoS2 ML, have valley pseudospin degrees of freedom 
in their band structures and valleytronics applications.[237] These valleys are optically 
addressable but degenerate in energy, so lifting their energy degeneracy by breaking 
time-reversal symmetry is crucial to valley manipulations. Usually, valley splitting in 
valley semiconductors can be induced by an out-of-plane magnetization through the 
magnetic proximity effect. By growing heterostructures of the ultrathin CrI3 and WSe2 
ML (Figure 11A), Zhong et al. observed a valley splitting of about 3 meV at a zero 
applied magnetic field below the TC of CrI3, comparable with the DFT calculated valley 
splitting of 2 meV.[72, 238] Besides, the conduction band of WSe2 ML lies above the spin-
polarized eg band of CrI3 in CrI3/WSe2, which leads to a valley polarization (Figure 
11B). Through the optical control of CrI3 magnetization, a wide continuous tuning of 
the valley splitting and valley polarization is realized in CrI3/WSe2.[239] Based on DFT 
calculation, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the interfacial atom superposition plays an 
important role and a W-Cr superposition is essential for a relatively large valley splitting 
in CrI3/WSe2.[240] They also demonstrated that valley splitting can be tuned in the 
trilayer CrI3/WSe2/CrI3 from nearly zero to more than two times of that in WSe2/CrI3 
by manipulating the layer alignment. Surprisingly, it is theoretically suggested that the 
valley splitting in the twisted WSe2/CrI3 can be strongly enhanced compared with the 
non-twisted WSe2/CrI3.[241, 242]

An out-of-plane magnetization induced valley splitting is observed in the 
heterostructure composed of of CrBr3 bilayer and MoSe2 ML. Figure 11C shows the 
optical micrograph of an experimentally grown CrBr3/MoSe2 heterostructure in a 
resonant optical spectroscopy measurement.[243] In the absence of an external magnetic 
field, the 𝐾𝐾 and 𝐾𝐾′ valley excitons are degenerate in bare MoSe2 and its spectrum 
has no polarization dependence (the upper panel in Figure 11D). In contrast, a valley 
splitting of 2.9 meV emerges in the CrBr3/MoSe2 heterostructure region (the bottom 
panel in Figure 11D). This valley splitting is further demonstrated to be directly linked 
to the magnetization of CrBr3. In addition, the valley splitting in CrBr3/MoSe2 
heterostructure exhibits an approximately linear dependence on the applied out-of-

Page 45 of 73 
 
plane electric field (Figure 11E), which is in line with theoretical results[246] and could 
has implications for gate-tunable valleytronic devices. 
 
  Although a CrSBr film is a layered A-type vdW antiferromagnet with an in-plane 
magnetic anisotropy, it can exert a magnetic proximity interaction on the valleys. By 
investigating the magneto photoluminescence of MoSe2 ML on the CrSBr film, Brito 
et al. observed a clear influence of the CrSBr magnetic order on the optical properties 
of MoSe2, such as an anomalous linear polarization dependence and changes of the 
exciton/trion energies.[247] Via time-resolved optical spectroscopy in combination with 
DFT calculations, Beer et al. demonstrated that MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructure has a 
type-III band alignment and the time-reversal symmetry of its MoSe2 ML is broken due 
to the magnetic proximity effect (Figure 11F).[248] Experimentally, the proximity-
induced spin splitting in this heterostructure is about 1.6 meV.  
  The out-of-plane magnetization induced valley splitting in heterostructures of ML 
valley semiconductors and 2D vdW magnetic materials is also explored in theoretical 
studies. Through constructing the heterostructures of two FM insulators (i.e., CrI3 and 
CrBr3) and five transition-metal dichalcogenide MLs (i.e., MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, 
and WSe2), Zhang et al. found using DFT calculations and the 𝒌𝒌∙𝒑𝒑 model analyses 
that MoTe2/CrBr3 heterostructure hosts a large valley splitting of about 28.7 meV.[244] 
Strikingly, they found that WSe2/CrBr3 is a valley-polarized QAHE system with Chern 
number CN = −1 at the K point while CN = 0 at the 𝐾𝐾′ point (Figure 11G). Based on 
the DFT calculation studies of the transition-metal dichalcogenide MLs and 2D 
magnetic materials NiY2 (Y = Cl, Br, I), Li et al. argued that large valley splitting can 
be obtained only when the vdW heterostructure has a type-III, instead of a type-I or 
type-II, band alignment.[249] For the VI3/WSe2 heterostructure, it is demonstrated that 
its valley splitting can be increased from 1.8 meV at 4% compressive strain to 3.1 meV 
at 4% tensile strain.[250] A DFT calculation of heterostructures of Cr2Ge2Te6 and 2H-
MX2 (M = Mo, W, and X = S, Se, Te) MLs suggested that Cr2Ge2Te6/2H-MX2 exhibits 
a stacking dependent valley splitting.[251] Particularly, a giant valley splitting of about 
38 meV can be achieved in theoretically designed heterostructure of transition-metal 
dichalcogenide MoTe2 ML and vdW Janus FM insulator CrSBr ML.[252]  
  As a result of the valley splitting, there can exist valley-dependent quantum states in 
heterostructures of ML valley semiconductor and 2D FM insulators. DFT calculations 
suggested that, the quantum valley Hall effect with a valley Chern number, Cv = 2, can 
show up in the heterostructure of germanene (Ge) and VBi2Te4 (Figure 11H) no matter 
this heterostructure has either an out-of-plane or in-plane magnetic moment.[245] For 
MnBi2Te4/Ge heterostructure, it displays QAHE when MnBi2Te4 has an out-of-plane 

Page 46 of 73 
 
magnetic moment.[245] However, MnBi2Te4/Ge heterostructure has quantum valley Hall 
effect with a valley Chern number, Cv = 2, when the magnetic moment is along the in-
plane direction. For NiBi2Te4/Ge heterostructure, it exhibits QAHE and the coexistence 
of quantum valley Hall effect and QAHE when its magnetic moment is along the out-
of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively.[245] Hence, valley-dependent quantum 
states are closely correlated to the magnetic anisotropy determined magnetic orientation 
of 2D FM materials in their vdW heterostructures with valley semiconductors.  
At the interfaces of 2D vdW magnetic heterostructures, the inversion symmetry is 
broken, and a strong DM interaction can be produced. As a result of the interplay 
between an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, exchange interaction and DM interaction, 
2D vdW magnetic heterostructure are promising platforms to explore the formation of 
magnetic skyrmions. Employing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, Wu et al. 
observed Néel-type magnetic skyrmions in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure (Figure 
12A).[253] Through growing Fe3GeTe2 under ambient condition, Park and Peng et al. 
fabricated a unique heterostructure of a Fe3GeTe2 layer sandwiched by two oxidized 
Fe3GeTe2 layers.[254, 255] Similar to WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure, they observed Néel-
type magnetic skyrmions in this heterostructure. In a heterostructure of Fe3GeTe2 and 
graphene, Srivastava et al. showed the emergence of Rashba-effect induced strong DM 
interactions at the graphene/Fe3GeTe2 interface.[256] Based on the measured topological 
Hall effect and DFT calculated magnetic parameters, they argued that the enhanced 
micromagnetic DM interactions prevails over the MAE, resulting in the formation of 
magnetic skyrmions in graphene/Fe3GeTe2. 
A vdW heterostructure of two 2D FM films, Cr2Ge2Te6 with a weak out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy and Fe3GeTe2 with a strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, is 
experimentally reported to host two groups of magnetic skyrmions.[257] Below the TC 
(~65 K) of Cr2Ge2Te6, the peak and dip features of Hall resistivity measurements 
showed the formation of magnetic skyrmions on Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 sides with 
opposite polarity in Fe3GeTe2/Cr2Ge2Te6 heterostructure (Figure 12B). However, above 
60 K, magnetic skyrmions only exist on the Fe3GeTe2 side. Given that the magnetic 
skyrmion size (about 100 nm) in Fe3GeTe2/Cr2Ge2Te6 heterostructure is larger than the 
magnetic domain size in commercial hard disk drives, electric gating is suggested to 
tune the magnetic skyrmion size, because the magnetic anisotropies of Fe3GeTe2 and 
Cr2Ge2Te6 can be modified.

The interface of 2D vdW magnetic heterostructure also gives a window to tune the 
magnetic anisotropy, which provides a possibility of manipulating magnetic skyrmions. 
In a vdW magnetic heterostructure of a 2D FM layer LaCl and a 2D ferroelectric layer 
In2Se3, it is theoretically shown that magnetic skyrmions in the form of bimerons can 
be created and annihilated in LaCl layer by switching the ferroelectric polarization of 
In2Se3 layer.[258] The core mechanism for such control of the magnetic skyrmions in 
LaCl/In2Se3 heterostructure is the polarization reversal induced magnetic anisotropy 
switching (Figure 12C). As a result of the controllable magnetic anisotropy of 2D Janus 
magnetic CrSeI, which is influenced by the polarization of 2D ferroelectric layer In2Te3, 
a switching between intrinsic magnetic skyrmion and high-temperature FM state is put 
forward in a vdW magnetic heterostructure CrSeI/In2Te3 by reversing the ferroelectric 
polarization of In2Te3.[259] In a vdW magnetic heterostructure of the FM CrCl3 and 2D 
topological insulator WTe2 ML, a combination of DFT calculations and micromagnetic 
simulations showed an out-of-plane magnetic field medicated Néel-type skyrmions-
bimeron-ferromagnet phase transition, which is largely driven by the competition 
between magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and an out-of-plane MCA.[260] Similarly, 
a magnetic field-controlled transition cycle between a Néel-type magnetic skyrmion 
lattice and FM states are theoretically demonstrated in CrTe2/WTe2 heterostructure.[261] 
Through DFT calculations and atomistic spin simulations, Li et al. predicted that a 
compressive strain leads to stabilizing zero-field skyrmions with diameters close to 10 

Page 48 of 73 
 
nm in a vdW heterostructure Fe3GeTe2/germanene.[262] The origin of these unique 
skyrmions can be attributed to the high tunability of DM interaction and MCA energy 
by strain.  
5. Methods to Tune Magnetic Anisotropy of 2D vdW Magnets 
Since the magnetic anisotropy of 2D vdW magnetic materials is closely linked to their 
electronic band states near the Fermi level, it can be effectively modulated by 
approaches that alter either the band structure or the Fermi level position. This review 
highlights several widely adopted strategies for tuning the properties of vdW magnetic 
materials, such as alloying, electrostatic gating, chemical doping, strain engineering, 
and interfacial engineering. 
Because the SOC of ligand atoms is of importance to magnetic anisotropy of 2D 
vdW magnetic materials, altering this SOC is expected to change magnetic anisotropy. 
In view of this, alloying of ligand atoms is adopted to tune the magnetic anisotropy in 
vdW magnetic materials. The alloyed CrCl3-xBrx is taken as an example here. As shown 
in Figure 13A, the subset of molecular orbital levels relevant to its charge-transfer 
processes is dependent on the ligand Cl or Br atoms due to the energy difference 
between 4p orbitals of Cl or 5p orbitals of Br. As a result, the effective SOC in CrCl3-
xBrx depends on the mixing ration between Cl and Br who have a different SOC. 
Considering this, Abramchuk et al. grew CrCl3-xBrx to explore the control of its 
magnetic anisotropy (Figure 13B).[263] The CrCl3-xBrx samples with different Br 
contents (x) exhibit different colors (Figure 13C). By studying the difference, ΔM = 
M(H||) − M(H⊥), as a function of magnetic field (the upper panel in Figure 13D), they 
found that CrCl3-xBrx samples with x < 2 exhibit a positive ΔM in the positive field 
direction, reminiscent of in-plane easy-axis. This behavior is inversed in samples with 
x > 2 where the easy axis acquires a dominant out-of-plane component. By defining an 
empirical anisotropy factor α = (Hh − He)/He where Hh and He mark the onset of 
saturation in magnetization curves along the hard and easy axes, they found that the 
magnetic anisotropy of CrCl3-xBrx crosses the boundary between in-plane and out-of-
plane at x = 2 (the bottom panel in Figure 13D). Considering the different SOC of 
halogen elements, it is expected that the magnetic anisotropy CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) can 
be modulated by alloying Cr, Br and I.

Alloying magnetic ions is also put forward to engineer magnetic anisotropy in vdW 
magnetic materials. Experimentally, motivated by the different magnetic anisotropies 
in the isostructural FePS3 (i.e. Ising-like) and NiPS3 (i.e., XXZ-like), Selter and Lee et 
al. studied the magnetic properties of Ni1-xFexPS3.[265, 266] They found that Ni1-xFexPS3 
shows a turnover from the XXZ-like to Ising-like magnetic anisotropy through x ≈ 
0.1. Given the weak SOC of Cr3+ ions in CrCl3 ML, alloying Cr3+ magnetic ions with 
isovalent Mo3+ or W3+ ions is theoretically proposed to strengthen its magnetic 
anisotropy,[144] because Mo3+ or W3+ ions have the same electronic configuration as Cr3+ 
magnetic ions but much larger SOC. DFT calculations showed that the doped CrMoCl6 
and CrWCl6 have an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropies,[144] which is different from the 
in-plane magnetic anisotropy in the pristine CrCl3 ML. 
Electrostatic gating can tune the magnetic anisotropy of vdW magnetic materials by 
introducing electron doping. In electron-doped (~1014 cm-2) Cr2Ge2Te6 thin film in an 
electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) devices (Figure 13E), Verzhbitskiy et al. 
revealed via angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements that the magnetic easy 
axis for heavily doped Cr2Ge2Te6 is along the in-plane direction (Figure 13F), in 
contrast to the out-of-plane easy axis of undoped Cr2Ge2Te6. Their DFT calculations 
indicated that the magnetic anisotropy of electron doped Cr2Ge2Te6 is out-of-plane for 
a low electron density but become in-plane for a high electron density (Figure 13G), 
which is consistent in general trend with their experimental observation of magnetic 
easy axis switching in the heavy doping limit. 
Electrochemical intercalation of organic ions is experimentally demonstrated to be 
an effective and convenient way to tune the magnetic anisotropy of Cr2Ge2Te6. Wang 
et al. reported that a hybrid superlattice (TBA)Cr2Ge2Te6 is formed when Cr2Ge2Te6 is 
intercalated with tetrabutyl ammonium cations (TBA+).[267] Different from the out-of-
plane magnetic easy axis of Cr2Ge2Te6, the magnetic easy axis of (TBA)Cr2Ge2Te6 lies 
in the ab-plane. This means a TBA+-intercalation induced magnetic easy axis switching 
in Cr2Ge2Te6. Their DFT calculations revealed that (TBA)Cr2Ge2Te6 is electron doped 
with conducting states coming from the dxz and dyz orbitals. Their calculations further 
indicated that the doublet dxz and dyz orbitals combining with other 3d orbitals would 
contribute an effective nonzero orbital magnetic moment ML // c = 0.0058 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵 and ML 
// a = 0.0281 𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵, mainly lying on the ab-plane. Due to the SOC of Cr ions, the planar 

Page 51 of 73 
 
orbital magnetic moments favor the spin alignment within the ab-plane in Cr2Ge2Te6 
intercalated with tetrabutylammonium cations. 
One feasible route to modify the magnetic anisotropy of vdW magnetic materials is 
the application of hydrostatic or tensile pressure. By applying hydrostatic pressure up 
to 2 GPa to Cr2Ge2Te6, Lin et al. reported that their anisotropic magnetoresistance 
measurements indicated that its magnetic anisotropy is switched from out-of-plane to 
in-plane when the hydrostatic pressure is larger than 1.0 GPa.[268] Their DFT 
calculations confirmed the giant MAE change with moderate pressure and assigned its 
origin to the increased off-site SOC of Te due to a shorter Cr-Te distance. However, a 
separate FMR study found that the magnetic orientation in Cr2Ge2Te6 remains to be 
out-of-plane up to 2.39 GPa, even though MAE was found to decrease under hydrostatic 
pressure.[269] The pressure induced reductions of out-of-plane MAE were also reported 
for two other vdW magnetic materials, CrI3 and CrBr3.[270, 271] 
A strain tunability of the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy is reported in VI3.[264] By 
employing thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a stretcher (Figure 13H), Zhang et al. 
carefully investigated the effect of tensile strain on the magnetic anisotropies of VI3 
flakes. They performed in situ magnetic circular dichroism measurements at 10 K in a 
reflection geometry of VI3 flakes with an external magnetic field along the c-axis of the 
sample. They found that the FM ground state of VI3 flakes is preserved, and the coercive 
force gradually increases from 1.78 T in the initial state to a maximum of 2.6 T under a 
3.8% tensile strain, as the tensile strain increases (Figure 13I). Their DFT calculations 
suggested that the increased MAE under tensile strain contributes to the enhancement 
of coercivity (Figure 13J). Meanwhile, they found the strain tunability on the coercivity 
of CrI3, with a similar crystal structure to VI3, is negligible in comparison with that in 
VI3 under the same tensile strain. They argued that the different strain tunability of 
magnetic anisotropy between VI3 and CrI3 may be mainly related to the strong MAE 
induced by unquenched orbital moment in VI3 but by ligand SOC in CrI3. The strain 
tunability of magnetic anisotropy in VI3 highlights its potential for integration into 2D 
vdW heterostructures. 
Theoretically, it is also shown that strain can tune the magnetic anisotropy of 2D 
vdW magnetic materials. Webster et al. performed a DFT study on the MAE of CrX3 
(X = Cl, Br, and I) ML under the influence of a biaxial strain. They found that the MAE 
increases when a compressive strain is applied in CrI3 while an opposite trend is 
observed in CrBr3 and CrCl3.[143] In particular, the MAE of CrI3 can be increased by 47% 
with a compressive strain of 5%. For the Cr2Ge2Te6 bilayer, a DFT study suggested that 
the direction of its magnetic easy axis can be converted from out-of-plane to in-plane 

Page 52 of 73 
 
due to the increase of a compressive strain.[272] Using DFT calculations, Kim et al. 
demonstrated that the out-of-plane MCA of Fe3GeTe2 ML and bilayer is retained with 
little change in the magnetic moments for the tensile strain.[198] On the other hand, 
abrupt decreases in their EMCA and changes in the magnetic moments are prominent for 
the compressive strain. In particular, Fe3GeTe2 bilayer even exhibits a sign change of 
EMCA, transforming from out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In Fe5GeTe2 ML, 
a compressive strain induced magnetic anisotropy switching from in-plane to out-of-
plane is shown by DFT calculations.[208] 
It has been shown that hole- or electron-doping can modulate the magnetic 
anisotropy of 2D vdW ferromagnets. By changing Fe content (i.e. hole doping), Fe3-
xGeTe2 exhibits a significant lower TC and largely reduced magnetic coercivity than 
Fe3GeTe2.[196] The large reduction in magnetic coercivity implies that Fe3-xGeTe2 has 
significantly smaller magnetic anisotropy than Fe3GeTe2.[196] The doping dependent 
changes in the electronic structures unveiled by XMCD, ARPES and DFT calculations 
showed that the decreased out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy is due to the reduction of 
the electron pockets which possess strong SOC induced band splitting that dominantly 
contributes to the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy (Figure 14A).[196] It is noteworthy 
that Fe3GaTe2, which is isostructural to Fe3GeTe2, also exhibits doping-driven tunable 
magnetic anisotropy.[273] This finding shows the intricate connection between electronic 
structures and magnetic anisotropies in 2D vdW magnetic materials. For CrBr3 ML, a 
DFT study showed that hole doping with an experimentally attainable hole density can 
boost its magnetic anisotropy as well as effective FM exchanges, thus leading to the 
room-temperature ferromagnetism.[274] Given the dependence of MAE on the electron 
or hole doping in CrI3 ML, DFT studies indicated doping electron into CrI3 ML via 
chemical adsorption of alkali and alkaline-earth elements can tune its magnetic 
anisotropy from out-of-plane to in-plane.[135, 275]  
Interface engineering is another effective approach to tune the magnetic anisotropy 
of 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures. By growing heterostructures 
of Fe3GeTe2 or oxidized Fe3GeTe2 with different thicknesses (Figure 14B), Kim et al. 
found a nonmonotonic behavior of an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropic field which 
originates from the competition between the interface and bulk MCA.[276] This is 
understandable because the interface MCA originating from only a few ML adjacent to 
the camping layer decreases with increasing Fe3GeTe2 thickness whereas the bulk one 
shows the opposite behavior. They even achieved local modulation of the out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy in the Fe3GeTe2/WSe2 heterostructure, attributing it to the presence  
of the adjacent ultrathin WSe2 layer, which possesses strong SOC. Interestingly, Idzuchi 
et al. reported that the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes is 

Page 53 of 73 
 
notably enhanced by using its heterostructure interface with an AFM insulator NiO.[277] 
They attributed this enhancement to interfacial strain and the bonding interactions 
between the 3d electrons of the transition metal and the 2p electrons of oxygen.

Similar to Fe3GeTe2, the strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of Fe3GaTe2 can 
be regulated using the nondestructive vdW interfacial magnetochemistry. By growing 
vdW heterostructures composed of Fe3GaTe2 and nonmagnetic vdW materials MoS2, 

Page 54 of 73 
 
WSe2, or Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3, the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of Fe3GaTe2 at the 
room temperature is reported to be weakened by 26.8%, though the TC is enhanced up 
to 400 K.[202] The analysis of the atom-resolved SOC energy based on DFT calculations 
further reveals that the interfacial SIA in these heterostructures mainly originates from 
the contributions of Fe and Te atoms in Fe3GaTe2 layer.[202] Due to the interlayer 
proximity effect, the total contribution from Fe and Te atoms to SIA in the Fe3GaTe2 
layer decreases from 3.13 to 1.89 meV/atom, ultimately leading to the experimentally 
observed weakening of the magnetic anisotropy in these heterostructures.  
The vdW heterostructures composed of 2D metallic and insulating ferromagnets also 
provide interesting platforms to explore the effect of the interface coupling on magnetic 
anisotropy. By constructing vdW heterostructure of metallic Fe3GeTe2 and insulating 
VI3, Tang et al. demonstrated via anomalous Hall effect measurement that the coercive 
field of Fe3GeTe2 is significantly increased by ~150%.[281] Their DFT calculations 
showed that Fe3GeTe2/VI3 heterostructure has an increased out-of-plane MAE than 
Fe3GeTe2, which is attributed to the spin coupling of the interface between Fe3GeTe2 
and VI3. 
Interestingly, Wang et al. found that the magnetic anisotropy of Fe4GeTe2 can be 
precisely controlled along either out-of-plane or in-plane through tailoring its Fe 
concentration.[278] As shown Figure 14C, although the magnetic anisotropy in Fe4GeTe2 
is temperature dependent, Fe4-xGeTe2 or Fe4+xGeTe2 always present a definite direction 
of magnetic anisotropy at all temperatures. It is notable that, when the Fe concentration 
decreases from Fe4+xGeTe2 to Fe4-xGeTe2, the magnetic anisotropy turns from in-plane 
to out-of-plane. Such varied magnetic anisotropy may originate from the out-of-plane 
MCA variation during the stoichiometry change. 
As a powerful way to modify the electronic structure near the Fermi level of materials, 
the high-pressure technique is employed to control the magnetic anisotropy of Fe-based 
vdW magnetic materials. By analyzing the anomalous Hall effect, magnetoresistance, 
and high-pressure X-ray diffraction, Li et al.[279] observed a pressure-driven magnetic 
phase transition among three FM phases with different magnetic easy axes, including 
the FM1 phase with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy, FM2 phase with an out-of-plane 
magnetic anisotropy, and FM3 phase with nearly isotropic magnetization (Figure 14D). 
Based on Hall measurements, they found that the dominant carriers of Fe5GeTe2 near 
the Fermi surface for the Hall effect are pressure-dependent. This indicates the pressure 
drives a Fermi surface reconstruction and changes the band structure in Fe5GeTe2, and 
finally leads to an effective control of its magnetic anisotropy. In Fe3GaTe2, a similar 
continuously tunable magnetic anisotropy from out-of-plane to in-plane is achieved via 

Page 55 of 73 
 
the application of pressure, which is also ascribed to the pressure-driven Fermi surface 
reconstruction.[282]  
Using electrical gating, Tang et al. reported the gate-tunable modulation of magnetic 
anisotropy, from an initial out-of-plane to a canted orientation and then finally to an in-
plane orientation, in vdW ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 (Figure 14E).[280] They also showed 
that the magnetic easy axis of Fe5GeTe2 continuously rotates via a spin-flop pathway 
and can be modulated in a range from 2.11 to -0.38 MJm-3. Physically, the cations (such 
as Li+ cations) of gating electrolytes are electrically driven into the vdW gaps of 
Fe5GeTe2 bulk without a structural phase transition or chemical reaction therein and 
finally cause extreme electron doping in Fe5GeTe2. As a result of doping, the itinerant 
electron density in Fe5GeTe2 can be tuned by gate, which is thus responsible for the 
transitions between magnetic states with different magnetic easy axes. 
Theoretically, many DFT studies show that constructing heterostructures of 2D vdW 
magnetic materials with other nonmagnetic materials can effectively tune the magnetic 
anisotropy. By building a multiferroic heterostructure of Cr2Ge2Te6 and ferroelectric 
In2Se3 ML, Gong et al. unveiled that the reversal polarization of In2Se3 switches the 
MCA of Cr2Ge2Te6 between out-of-plane and in-plane orientations.[283] Their detailed 
analysis suggested that the interfacial hybridization is the cause of the MCA switching 
in Cr2Ge2Te6/In2Se3. Compared with the pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 ML, it is shown that the 
MAE of Cr2Ge2Te6/PtSe2 heterostructure is enhanced by 70%.[284] An analysis of DFT 
results with a model Hamiltonian revealed that both DM interactions and SIA contribute 
to the enhancement of the MAE in Cr2Ge2Te6/PtSe2. Through building heterostructures 
of CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) ML and the ferroelectric AlN bilayer, Zhu et al. demostrated 
that the magnetic easy axis of CrX3 ML can be switched between out-of-plane and in-
plane directions when the polarization direction of the AlN bilayer is reversed.[285] They 
also showed that the different effects of the AlN bilayer on the modulation of the 
magnetic easy axis of CrX3 ML are related with their different interfacial charge 
transfer/redistribution across the interfaces. A study of heterostructure of MnBi2Te4 ML 
and 2D ferroelectric III2-VI3 (III = Al, Ga, In; VI = Se, Te) substrates found polarization 
reversal induced reorientation of magnetic easy axis.[286] Such reorientation is attributed 
to the sensitivity of the MCA of MnBi2Te4 ML to the charge redistribution and 
interfacial hybridization in MnBi2Te4/III2-VI3 heterostructure.  
Finally, it is suggested that the magnetic anisotropy of a 2D antiferromagnet can be 
greatly enhanced via stacking it on a magnetic substrate.[287] Such enhancement arises 
from a sublattice-dependent interlayer magnetic interaction that strongly couples with 
the interlayer stacking order and magnetic order of the substrate layer. To demonstrate

this enhancement, Xiao et al. constructed a vdW magnetic heterostructure of MnPS3 
bilayer and CrCl3.[287] Although MnPS3 has a very weak MAE, their DFT calculations 
suggested that the MAE of MnPS3/CrCl3 is 40 times as large as that of MnPS3. 
Meanwhile, there is a strong coupling between the MAE and stacking order in 
MnPS3/CrCl3. Such tunable magnetic anisotropy in vdW heterostructures is of interest 
for stabilizing and manipulating 2D magnetism. 
6. Conclusion and Outlook 
Throughout this review, we have highlighted the critical role of magnetic anisotropy in 
stabilizing and shaping long-range magnetic orders in 2D systems, as well as in 
determining the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW magnetic 
materials and their heterostructures. While the well-known Mermin-Wagner theorem[3] 
states that an isotropic 2D Heisenberg model cannot support long-range magnetic 
ordering at finite temperatures, experimental evidence from ultrathin magnetic films[30] 
and atomically thin 2D vdW magnetic MLs clearly shows the existence of 2D 
magnetism in various systems. This apparent contradiction arises because the Mermin-
Wagner theorem does not account for magnetic anisotropy, which is a key symmetry-
breaking factor in real 2D magnetic materials. The core mechanism enabling the 
stabilization of 2D magnetism lies in the ability of magnetic anisotropy to break the 
continuous rotational symmetry, thereby suppressing the divergence of spin-wave 
excitations that would otherwise destroy long-range orders at finite temperatures. [53] 
Moreover, magnetic anisotropy not only stabilizes magnetism but also dictates the 
preferred direction of magnetizations in 2D vdW magnetic materials and their 
heterostructures. Since the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of these 
materials are often highly sensitive to the magnetization direction, magnetic anisotropy 
emerges as a central parameter in the design and realization of future 2D spintronic and 
quantum devices. 
  Given the importance of magnetic anisotropy in 2D vdW magnetic materials and 
their heterostructures, we have also reviewed its underlying mechanisms and tuning 
strategies explored in both theoretical and experimental studies. Among the three 
primary components of magnetic anisotropy, the MSA is the most straightforward, as it 
arises solely from the magnetic moments and lattice geometry, as described by Eq. (3). 
In contrast, MCA and exchange anisotropy are more complex, because they depend 
intricately on the electronic structure of the specific magnetic material. Both typically 
originate from either the strong SOC of surrounding ligands or the unquenched orbital 
magnetic moments of the magnetic ions, or a combination of both. Fundamentally, 
MCA and exchange anisotropy are governed by the band states near the Fermi level,

making them sensitive to the changes in the electronic environment. Based on this 
understanding, a variety of approaches have been demonstrated to effectively tune 
magnetic anisotropy, including electrostatic gating, charge doping (via holes or 
electrons), cation or anion alloying, application of strain or hydrostatic pressure, and 
engineering of interfaces or heterostructures. These strategies provide a versatile 
toolbox for tailoring the magnetic properties of 2D vdW magnetic materials, thus 
enabling their optimization for future spintronic and quantum applications. 
  Despite the intensive research on 2D vdW magnetic materials and their 
heterostructures in recent years, the understanding and control of their magnetic 
anisotropies remain challenging and incomplete. A primary unresolved issue is the lack 
of theoretical consensus on which anisotropic interaction terms are most critical in 
determining magnetic anisotropy. While it is broadly accepted that strong ligand SOC 
and unquenched orbital magnetic moments play essential roles, the exact contributions 
of various symmetry-allowed anisotropic interactions remain debated. Even in the well-
studied systems like CrI3, significant uncertainty persists regarding the magnitudes and 
relevance of anisotropic exchange interactions, SIA, Kitaev interactions, and second-
neighbor DM interactions.[288] Compounding the issue, computational predictions such 
as the MCA of multilayer Cr2Ge2Te2 are found to be highly sensitive to the choice of 
exchange-correlation functional in DFT calculations.[151] Another critical yet difficult 
challenge is achieving sufficiently strong magnetic anisotropy, which is vital for 
stabilizing robust and high-temperature 2D magnetism. Currently, most 2D vdW 
magnets rely on SOC arising from p or d orbitals of 3d elements, which is often not 
strong enough. In contrast, 5d and rare-earth elements have significantly stronger SOC, 
making them promising candidates for enhancing magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, 
strategies such as doping 5d and rare-earth elements into existing 2D vdW magnetic 
materials hold substantial potential for realizing stronger anisotropic effects and 
advancing the field of 2D magnetism. 
  Last but not least, the magnetic anisotropy of moiré magnetism in twisted 2D vdW 
magnetic materials remains largely unexplored. Recent studies have shown that moiré 
engineering in these systems can give rise to unconventional nanoscale magnetism, 
including the coexistence of FM and AFM domains, as well as non-collinear spin 
textures in twisted CrI3 bilayers.[289-294] Moreover, magnetic skyrmions have been 
observed in twisted heterostructures composed of a FM ML interfaced with a layered 
AFM substrate.[295] These discoveries suggest that twist-induced modifications to the 
electronic density of states[296] and the intrinsic breaking of inversion symmetry in 
moiré superlattices[297] could give rise to novel mechanisms of magnetic anisotropy—
mechanisms that are currently unpredictable within existing theoretical frameworks.

However, the extreme complexity and twist-angle-dependent sensitivity of moiré 
systems make the theoretical determination of magnetic anisotropy, especially through 
DFT calculations, highly challenging. This is particularly true for arbitrary twist angles 
that lead to incommensurate structures, which are computationally intractable using 
conventional methods. Given the recent success of machine learning in modeling and 
predicting properties of magnetic materials,[298, 299] there is a promising opportunity to 
leverage these techniques for studying the magnetic anisotropy in twisted 2D vdW 
magnetic materials. Such approaches may offer a viable path forward for uncovering 
and understanding emergent anisotropic phenomena in moiré magnetism. 
  In conclusion, magnetic anisotropy has emerged as a central factor in the study of 2D 
magnetic materials and their heterostructures, playing a crucial role in stabilizing long-
range magnetic orders in 2D systems. Both experimental and theoretical investigations 
have significantly advanced our understanding of its underlying mechanisms, 
particularly the roles of MCA, MSA, and exchange anisotropy. Moreover, a variety of 
innovative approaches, ranging from strain engineering and pressure tuning to gating, 
doping, and heterostructure design, have been demonstrated as effective strategies for 
modulating magnetic anisotropy. As we continue to explore the potential applications 
of 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures in next-generation electronic, 
spintronic, and topological devices, there lies a wealth of opportunities for deeper 
investigations. In particular, the accurate determination, comprehensive understanding, 
and precise engineering of magnetic anisotropy will remain vital frontiers, especially 
in the context of complex phenomena such as the moiré magnetism and twisted 
heterostructures. The ongoing synergy between theory, experiment, and emerging tools 
like machine learning holds great promise for unlocking the full potential of 2D 
magnetic systems.
