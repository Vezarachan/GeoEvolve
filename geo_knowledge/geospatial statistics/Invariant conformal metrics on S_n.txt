Abstract
In this paper we use the relationship between conformal metrics on the sphere and horo-
spherically convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space for giving sufﬁcient conditions on
a conformal metric to be radial under some constrain on the eigenvalues of its Schouten ten-
sor. Also, we study conformal metrics on the sphere which are invariant by a k−parameter
subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms of the sphere, giving a bound on its maximum
dimension.
Moreover, we classify conformal metrics on the sphere whose eigenvalues of the Shouten
tensor are all constant (we call them isoparametric conformal metrics), and we use a clas-
siﬁcation result for radial conformal metrics which are solution of some σk−Yamabe type
problem for obtaining existence of rotational spheres and Delaunay-type hypersurfaces for
some classes of Weingarten hypersurfaces in Hn+1.

Introduction
In the last 30 years, the Nirenberg Problem, i.e., which functions S : Sn −→R arise as the
scalar curvature of some conformal metric on the sphere?, has received an amazing number
of contributions (see [1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34]), but sufﬁcient and
necessary conditions for the solvability are still unknown.

However, this problem opened the door of a rich subject in the last few years, conformally
invariant equations. Let F(x1, . . . , xn) denote a smooth functional, and let Γ ∈C∞(Sn). Does
there exist a conformal metric g = e2ρg0 on Sn such that the eigenvalues λi of its Schouten
tensor verify
F(λ1, . . . , λn) = Γ, on Sn.
Given (M, g) a Riemannian manifold, for n ≥3, the Schouten tensor of g is given by
Schg :=
1
n −2

Ric(g) −
S(g)
2(n −1)g

where Ric(g) and S(g) are the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature function of g respectively.
Note that, when F(x1, . . . , xn) = x1 +· · ·+xn we have the Nirenberg Problem. Right now,
the most developed topic for these equations is when we consider F(λ1, . . . , λn) ≡σk(λi) as
the k−th elementary symmetric polynomial of its arguments equals to a constant, i.e.,
σk(λi) = constant.
(1.1)
Many deep results are known for these equations (see [7, 8, 9, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36] and
reference therein). Mostly of these results are devoted to solutions either on Sn or Rn, and little
is known when we look for conformal metrics on a domain of the sphere (see [32, 33] and
references therein). In this line, Chang-Han-Yang [10] have classiﬁed all posible radial solution
to the equation (1.1) “as guidance in studying the behavior of singular solutions in the general
situation”. This is natural since radial solutions are the simplest examples. Thus, the next step
is: under what (local) conditions can we know that the solution is radial?
In a recent paper [21], the authors showed a correspondence between conformal metrics
on the sphere and horospherically convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space. Here, they
provide a back-and-forth construction which give a hypersurface theory interpretation for the
famous Nirenberg Problem, relating it with a natural formulation of the Christoffel problem
in Hn+1. Moreover, this correspondence is more general and it relates conformally invariant
equations with Weingarten hypersurfaces horospherically convex. The main line in this paper
is to use the deep theorems on conformal geometry to infer results in the hypersurface theory,
but, how can the hypersurface theory help to get information on conformal geometry?
We will see here that, using the hypersurface setting, we can obtain sufﬁcient conditions
under which a conformal metric is radial among others on invariant conformal metrics under a
subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms of the sphere. We should mention that the theorems
included here are local results, besides the usuals on this direction that they are from a global
character.
In Section 2 we establish the necessary preliminaries on conformal geometry, and it is de-
voted also to summarize the correspondence developed in [21] between conformal metrics and
2

horospherically convex hypersurfaces, that is, given a conformal metric on the sphere they con-
struct a horospherically convex hypersurface in Hn+1 and viceversa. In Section 3 we establish
that if a conformal metric is invariant under a subgroup of conformal diffeomorphism of the
sphere, then its associated horospherically convex hypersurface is invariant under the subgroup
of isometries induce by the subgroup of conformal diffeomorphism, and viceversa, i.e.,
Lemma 3.1:
Let φ : Ω⊂Sn −→Hn+1 be a locally horospherically convex hypersurface with hyperbolic
Gauss map G(x) = x, support function eρ : Ω−→(0, +∞), and let g = e2ρg0 denote its
horospherical metric. Let T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) be an isometry and Φ ∈D(Sn) its associated
conformal diffeomorphism. Thus, if φ is T|Hn+1 −invariant then g is Φ−invariant.
Conversely, let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn
such that the eigenvalues of its Schouten tensor, Schg, verify
sup {λi(x), x ∈Ω, i = 1, . . . , n} < +∞.
Let Φ ∈D(Sn) be a conformal difeomorphism and T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) its associated isom-
etry. Thus, if g is Φ−invariant then φ, given by (2.3), is T|Hn+1 −invariant.
In Section 4 we classify the conformal metrics on the sphere whose eigenvalues of its
Shouten tensor are all constant, we call these metrics isoparametric conformal metrics. Since
the above classiﬁcation have not been done before (as far as we know), we will include here.
In Section 5 we state our main results, we give sufﬁcient conditions under which a conformal
metric is radial in terms of the eigenvalues of its Shouten tensor,
Theorem 5.1:
Let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn such that
the eigenvalues, λi, for i = 1, . . . , n, of its Schouten tensor, Schg, verify
sup {λi(x), x ∈Ω, i = 1, . . . , n} < +∞.
Furthermore, assume that the eigenvalues satisfy
λ = λ1 = · · · = λn−1
ν = ν(λ) = λn
λ −ν ̸= 0.
Then, g is radial.
Moreover, we study conformal metrics on the sphere which are invariant by a k−parameter
subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms of the sphere, giving a bound on its maximum dimen-
sion,

Theorem 5.2:
Let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn such that
g ̸∈C(n) and the eigenvalues, λi, for i = 1, . . . , n, of its Schouten tensor, Schg, verify
sup {λi(x), x ∈Ω, i = 1, . . . , n} < +∞.
Suppose that g is invariant by a k−parameter subgroup of conformal diffeormorphism G ≤
D(Sn). Then the maximum value of k is kmax = n(n−1)
2
, and if k = kmax, the Schouten tensor of
g, Schg has two eigenvalues λ and ν, where one of them, say λ, has multiplicity at least n −1.
If, in addition, λ ̸= 0, ν = ν(λ) and ν −λ ̸= 0, then g is radial.
Finally, in Section 6, we give some existence results for some classes of Weingarten hy-
persurfaces which are rotationally invariants and horospherically convex, based on a result of
Chang-Han-Yang [10].

Preliminaries
2.1
On conformal geometry
Let (Mn, g), n ≥3, be a Riemannian manifold. The Riemann curvature tensor, Riem, can be
decomposed as
Riem = Wg + Schg ⊙g,
where Wg is the Weyl tensor, ⊙is the Kulkarni-Nomizu product, and
Schg :=
1
n −2

Ricg −
S(g)
2(n −1)g

is the Schouten tensor. Here Ricg and S(g) stand for the Ricci curvature and scalar curvature of
g respectively.
The eigenvalues of Schg are deﬁned as the eigenvalues of the endomorphism g−1Schg and
we will denote them by λi, i = 1, . . . , n.
It is well known that the Schouten tensor encodes all the information on how curvature varies
by a conformal change of metric. It is worth it to remark that the Weyl curvature tensor vanishes
identically when (Mn, g) is locally conformally ﬂat since it is the situation of the present work.
We will consider conformal metrics to the standard metric on the n−sphere, (Sn, g0), i.e.,
g = e2ρg0.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let us denote by D(Sn) the group of conformal diffeomorphisms on the sphere
and Φ ∈D(Sn) a conformal diffeomorphism. Let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on
a domain Ω⊂Sn. g is Φ−invariant if
gx(u, v) = (Φ∗g)x(u, v), ∀x ∈Ω, ∀u, v ∈TxSn, such that Φ(x) ∈Ω.
4

Moreover, given a continuous subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms G ≤D(Sn), g is
G−invariant if it is Φ−invariant for all Φ ∈G.
The basic example of G−invariant metric is that which is radial symmetric, i.e., when G is
a subgroup of rotations. In this case, we say that g is radial.
2.2
On hypersurface theory
First, let us establish the necessary notation that we will use along the work. Actually, we will
summarize here the construction developed in [21] for the sake of completeness, that is, in order
to prove our results, we will use the correspondence between conformal metrics on the sphere
and locally horospherically convex hypersurfaces in Hn+1. So, we will remind, in a short way,
how to construct a locally horospherically convex hypersurface from a conformal metric on the
sphere.
Let us denote by Ln+2 the (n+2)−dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space, i.e., the vectorial
space Rn+2 endowed with the Lorentzian metric ⟨, ⟩given by
⟨¯x, ¯x⟩= −x2
0 +
n+1
X
i=1
x2
i ,
where ¯x ≡(x0, x1, . . . , xn+1) ∈Rn+2.
So, the (n + 1)−dimensional hyperbolic space, de-Sitter space and null cone are given,
respectively, by the hyperquadrics
Hn+1 =

¯x ∈Ln+2 : ⟨¯x, ¯x⟩= −1, x0 > 0
	
Sn+1
1
=

¯x ∈Ln+2 : ⟨¯x, ¯x⟩= 1
	
Nn+1
+
=

¯x ∈Ln+2 : ⟨¯x, ¯x⟩= 0, x0 > 0
	
.
It is well know that Hn+1 inherits from (Ln+2, ⟨, ⟩) a Riemannian metric which make it the
standard model of Riemannian space of constant sectional curvature −1. Its ideal boundary at
inﬁnity, ∂∞Hn+1, will be denoted by Sn
∞.
Horospheres will play an essential role in what follows, so, we go through describing their
most important properties. In this model, horospheres in Hn+1 are the intersection of afﬁne
degenerate hyperplanes of Ln+2 with Hn+1. Thus, it is clear that the boundary at inﬁnity is
a single point x ∈Sn
∞. In this way, two horospheres are always congruent, and they are at
a constant (hyperbolic) distance if their respective points at inﬁnity agree. Moreover, given a
point x ∈Sn
∞, horospheres having x as its point at inﬁnity provide a foliation of Hn+1.
From now on, φ : Mn −→Hn+1 will denote an oriented immersed hypersurface and
η : Mn −→Sn+1
1
its unit normal.
5

Deﬁnition 2.2 ([17, 18, 4]). Let φ : Mn −→Hn+1 denote an immersed oriented hypersurface
in Hn+1 with unit normal η. The hyperbolic Gauss map
G : Mn −→Sn
∞≡Sn
of φ is deﬁned as follows: for every p ∈Mn, G(p) ∈Sn
∞is the point at inﬁnity of the unique
horosphere in Hn+1 passing through φ(p) and whose inner unit normal at p agrees with η(p).
Associated to φ, let us consider the map
ψ := φ + η : Mn −→Nn+1
+
,
called the associated light cone map.
The map ψ is strongly related to the hyperbolic Gauss map G : Mn −→Sn
∞of φ. Indeed,
the ideal boundary of Nn+1
+
coincides with Sn
∞, and can be identiﬁed with the projective quotient
space Nn+1
+
/R+. So, with all of this, we have G = [ψ] : Mn −→Sn
∞≡Nn+1
+
/R+.
Note that ψ0 > 0, being ψ = (ψ0, ψ1, . . . , ψn+1) ∈Ln+2. If we label ψ0 := eρ, then we can
interpret the hyperbolic Gauss map as the map
G : Mn −→Sn = Nn+1
+
∩

x ∈Ln+2 : x0 = 1
	
given by
ψ = eρ(1, G).
(2.1)
Moreover, we call eρ the horospherical support function. Also, if {e1, . . . , en} denotes an
orthonormal basis of principal directions of φ at p, and if κ1, . . . , κn are the associated principal
curvatures, it is immediate that
⟨(dψ)p(ei), (dψ)p(ej)⟩= (1 −κi)2δij = e2ρ⟨(dG)p(ei), (dG)p(ej)⟩Sn.
(2.2)
Coming back to horospheres, we must remark that horospheres are the unique hypersurfaces
such that, innerly oriented (i.e., when the unit normal points to the convex side), its associated
light cone map is constant: φ + η = v ∈Nn+1
+
. Moreover, if we write v = eρ(1, x), we see that
x ∈Sn is the point at inﬁnity of the horosphere and ρ is the signed hyperbolic distant of the
horosphere to the point O = (1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈Hn+1 ⊂Ln+2.
In the hyperbolic setting we have a notion of convexity weaker than the usual geodesic
convexity, i.e.,
Deﬁnition 2.3 ([35]). Let Mn ⊂Hn+1 be an immersed oriented hypersurface, and let Hp
denote the horosphere in Hn+1 that is tangent to Mn at p, and whose interior unit normal at p
agrees with the one of Mn. We will say that Mn is horospherically convex at p if there exists a
neighborhood V ⊂Mn of p so that V \ {p} does not intersect Hp, and in addition the distance
function of the hypersurface to the horosphere does not vanish up to the second order at p in
any direction.
6

Thus, from (2.2), we have the following characterization of horospherically convex hyper-
surfaces:
Lemma 2.1. Let φ : Mn −→Hn+1 be an oriented hypersurface. The following conditions are
equivalent at p ∈Mn.
(i) All principal curvatures of Mn at p are simultaneously < 1 or > 1.
(ii) Mn is horospherically convex at p.
In particular, if φ : Mn −→Hn+1 is horospherically convex at p, then its Gauss map verify
dGp ̸= 0.
So, if Mn is horospherically convex at p, therefore dGp ̸= 0 and there exist neighborhoods
U ⊂Mn and Ω⊂Sn such that G : U −→Ωis a diffeomorphism, and
g = e2ρ⟨dG, dG⟩Sn
deﬁne a conformally ﬂat Riemannian metric on Mn, called the horospherical metric. Since G
is a diffeomorphism between U and Ωwe can use it as a parametrization of the hypersurface,
i.e., we can assume that φ : Ω⊂Sn −→Hn+1 and G(x) = x on Ω⊂Sn.
Thus, if G : Mn −→Ω⊆Sn is a global diffeormorphism of the hypersurface onto a domain
of the sphere, we can use the hyperbolic Gauss map as a global parametrization of φ as above,
i.e., φ : Ω−→Hn+1 and G(x) = x. In this case, the horospherical metric is given by
g = e2ρg0.
Now, we are ready to establish the mentioned relationship between conformal metrics on
the sphere and horospherically convex hypersurfaces
Theorem 2.1 ([21]). Let φ : Ω⊂Sn −→Hn+1 be a horospherically convex hypersurface with
hyperbolic Gauss map G(x) = x, support function eρ : Ω−→(0, +∞), and let g = e2ρg0
denote its horospherical metric. Then it holds
φ = eρ
2
 1 + e−2ρ  1 + ||∇g0ρ||2
g0

(1, x) + e−ρ(0, −x + ∇g0ρ).
(2.3)
Moreover, the eigenvalues, λi, of the Schouten tensor of g, Schg, and the principal curva-
tures, κi, of φ are related by
λi = 1
2 −
1
1 −κi
.
(2.4)
Conversely, given a conformal metric g = e2ρg0 deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn
such that the eigenvalues of its Schouten tensor, Schg, are less than 1/2, then the map φ : Ω−→
Hn+1 given by (2.3) deﬁnes a horospherically convex hypersurface in Hn+1 whose hyperbolic
Gauss map is given by G(x) = x, x ∈Ω.
7

Remark 2.1. We must say that the condition on the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor is easily
removable, i.e., we only need to ask that
sup {λi(x), i = 1, . . . , n, x ∈Ω} < +∞.
If this occurs, we can dilate the metric g as gt = etg for t > 0. Then, the eigenvalues of
Schgt are given by
λt
i = e−tλi.
Thus, for t big enough, we can achieve λt
i < 1/2 for i = 1, . . . , n.

Conformal diffeomorphisms and isometries
Let us denote by I(Ln+2), I(Hn+1) and I(Nn+1
+
) the group of isometries of Ln+2, the (n +
1)−dimensional hyperbolic space and the (n + 1)−dimensional null cone respectively.
It is well known (see [16]) that a conformal diffeormorphism Φ ∈D(Sn) induce a unique
isometry in Ln+2, T ∈I(Ln+2), such that restricted to Hn+1 and Nn+1
+
induces an isometry in
these spaces and viceversa. The restrictions of T ∈I(Ln+2) to Hn+1 and Nn+1
+
will be denote
by T|Hn+1 and T|Nn+1
+
respectively. Moreover, each isometry T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) induce an
unique isometry T|Nn+1
+
∈I(Nn+1
+
) and viceversa.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let Mn ⊂Nn be a domain of a n−manifold N. Let φ : Mn ⊂Nn −→Hn+1
be a hypersurface and T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) an isometry. φ is T|Hn+1 −invariant if there exists
iT|Hn+1 : Nn −→Nn a diffeomorphism such that
(T|Hn+1 ◦φ)(p) =

φ ◦iT|Hn+1

(p), ∀p ∈Mn such that iT|Hn+1 (p) ∈Mn.
Moreover, given a continuous subgroup of isometries T ≤I(Hn+1), φ is T −invariant if it
is T|Hn+1 −invariant for all T|Hn+1 ∈T .
The next result state the relationship between conformal metrics on the sphere which are
invariant by a conformal diffeomorphism and horospherically convex hypersurfaces which are
invariant by an isometry.
Lemma 3.1. Let φ : Ω⊂Sn −→Hn+1 be a locally horospherically convex hypersurface with
hyperbolic Gauss map G(x) = x, support function eρ : Ω−→(0, +∞), and let g = e2ρg0
denote its horospherical metric. Let T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) be an isometry and Φ ∈D(Sn) its
associated conformal diffeomorphism. Thus, if φ is T|Hn+1 −invariant then g is Φ−invariant.
8

Conversely, let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn
such that the eigenvalues of its Schouten tensor, Schg, are less than 1/2. Let Φ ∈D(Sn)
be a conformal difeomorphism and T|Hn+1 ∈I(Hn+1) its associated isometry. Thus, if g is
Φ−invariant then φ, given by (2.3), is T|Hn+1 −invariant.
Proof. On one hand, if φ is horospherically convex, φ is T|Hn+1 −invariant if and only if its
associated light cone map ψ is T|Nn+1
+
−invariant, i.e., if

T|Nn+1

(x) = (ψ ◦Φ) (x), x ∈Ωsuch that Φ(x) ∈Ω.
(3.1)
being Φ ∈D(Sn) the conformal diffeomorphism associated to T|Nn+1
+
∈I(Nn+1
+
).
On the other hand, we have an explicit correspondence between conformal diffeomorphisms
on the sphere and isometries on Nn+1
+
(see [16, Proposition 7.4]). Given an isometry T|Nn+1
+
∈
I(Nn+1
+
), at points (1, x) ∈Sn = Nn+1
+
∩

x ∈Ln+2 : x0 = 1
	
we can see it as
T|Nn+1
+
((1, x)) = e−ω(x)(1, Φ(x)),
then Φ : Sn −→Sn deﬁnes a conformal diffeomorphism on the n−sphere with conformal factor
eω. Conversely, given a conformal diffeomorphism Φ ∈D(Sn) with conformal factor eω, at any
point et(1, x) ∈Nn+1
+
deﬁne
T|Nn+1
+
(et(1, x)) = ete−ω(x)(1, Φ(x)),
then T|Nn+1
+
∈I(Nn+1
+
).
We ﬁrst prove the converse. By the previous considerations, we only need to prove (3.1).
Thus, if g = e2ρg0 is Φ−invariant, hence by Deﬁnition 2.1 we have that
ρ(x) = ρ(Φ(x)) + ω(x), provided Φ(x) ∈Ω.
Let T|Nn+1
+
be the isometry of Nn+1
+
associated to Φ, then

T|Nn+1
+
◦ψ

(x) = T|Nn+1
+
(eρ(x)(1, x)) = eρ(x)−ω(x)(1, Φ(x))
= eρ(Φ(x))(1, Φ(x)) = ψ(Φ(x)) = (ψ ◦Φ) (x).
Now, if φ is T|Hn+1 −invariant, following the above computations, we can observe that
ρ(x) = ρ(Φ(x)) + ω(x),
being eω : Ω→R the conformal factor of the conformal diffeomorphism, Φ, associated to
T|Hn+1 . Thus, g is Φ−invariant.

Isoparametric conformal metrics
Here, we will classify the class of conformal metrics on the sphere such that all the eigenvalues
of its Schouten tensor are constant, we denote this class by C(n).
The local classiﬁcation of conformal metrics on the class g ∈C(n) can be done through
a result of E. Cartan [5]. Suppose g ∈C(n) therefore, after possibly a dilation, the associ-
ated hypersurface given by Theorem 2.1 is an isoparametric hypersurface in Hn+1, i.e., all its
principal curvatures are constant. Thus, it is a piece of either a totally umbilical hypersurface
(hypersphere, horosphere, totally geodesic hyperplane and equidistant) or a standard product
Sk × Hn−k in Hn+1. For this reason, we will call a metric in C(n) an isoparametric conformal
metric.
It is known that solutions of
•
σk(λi) = 1 on Sn
are given by conformal diffeomorphisms of the standard metric on the sphere. Such
solution corresponds to a hypersphere via Theorem 2.1 (see [21]).
•
σk(λi) = 0 on Rn
are explictly known (see [27]). Such solution corresponds to a horosphere via Theorem
2.1 (see [21]).
Now, our task is to compute explicitly the horospeherical support function associated to a
totally geodesic hyperplane, an equidistant hypersurface and a standard product Sk × Hn−k. To
do so, we will give the parametrization of such hypersurface and its unit normal vector ﬁeld
and, by means of equation (2.1), we will have an explicit formula for the horospherical support
function and hyperbolic Gauss map. Thus, for an isoparametric hypersurface φ : Ω⊂Rn −→
Hn+1 ⊂Ln+2 with unit normal η : Ω⊂Rn −→Sn+1
1
⊂Ln+2, we will have
ρ : Ω⊂Rn −→R,
and
G : Ω⊂Rn −→D ⊂Sn global diffeomorphism.
Hence, the isoparametric conformal metric associated to that hypersurface is given by
g = eρ(G−1(y))g0, y ∈D.
(4.1)
Let us describe the announced examples:

In this case, the principal curvatures all are equals to zero, ki = 0, i = 1, . . . , n. Thus,

i = 1, . . . , n.

In this case, the principal curvatures all are equals to −t/R, ki = −t/R, i = 1, . . . , n.
Thus, the eigenvalues of the Shouten tensor associated to g (given by (4.1)) are λi =
−(R + t)/2(R −t), i = 1, . . . , n.

Remark 4.1. As we pointed out at the begin of the Section, hyperspheres and horospheres are
the only solutions for σk(λi) = 1 on Sn and σk(λi) = 0 on Rn. The other cases deﬁne complete
metrics on a subdomain of the sphere. So, the natural question is: Are these solutions the only
solutions for such domains under the constrain σk(λi) = constant?
5
Invariant conformal metrics on the sphere
In this Section we will give sufﬁcient conditions for a conformal metric on the sphere to be
radial. The following local result is based on the correspondence given in Theorem 2.1, Lemma
2.1 and a deep result of Do Carmo-Dajzcer for hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.
Theorem 5.1. Let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn
such that the eigenvalues, λi, for i = 1, . . . , n, of its Schouten tensor, Schg, verify
sup {λi(x), x ∈Ω, i = 1, . . . , n} < +∞.
Furthermore, assume that the eigenvalues satisfy
λ = λ1 = · · · = λn−1
ν = ν(λ) = λn
λ −ν ̸= 0.
Then, g is radial.
Proof. Consider t > 0 big enough such that the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor of gt = e2tg
are less than 1/2 (see Remark 2.1). Consider the horospherically convex hypersurface, φ :
Ω−→Hn+1, associated to gt given by (2.3) in Theorem 2.1. Hence, the principal curvatures of
φ verify:
˜λ = κ1 = · · · = κn−1
˜ν = ˜ν(˜λ) = κn
˜λ −˜ν ̸= 0,
this follows from (2.4) and the assumptions on the eigenvalues of Schg. Hence, using [6, The-
orem 4.2], φ(Ω) is contained in a rotational hypersurface, which means, via Lemma 3.1, that gt
is radial, so g is radial.
13

The next result is about determining which conformal metrics on the sphere are invariant
by a k−parameter subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms of the sphere. We should remove
the class of conformal metrics on the sphere such that all the eigenvalues of its Schouten tensor
are constant, C(n), but this is not a signiﬁcant problem, since there are not too many of them
and we have classify them. Again, the result is based on a Theorem of M. Do Carmo and M.
Dajczer.
Theorem 5.2. Let g = e2ρg0 be a conformal metric deﬁned on a domain of the sphere Ω⊂Sn
such that g ̸∈C(n) and the eigenvalues, λi, for i = 1, . . . , n, of its Schouten tensor, Schg, verify
sup {λi(x), x ∈Ω, i = 1, . . . , n} < +∞.
Suppose that g is invariant by a k−parameter subgroup of conformal diffeormorphism G ≤
D(Sn). Then the maximum value of k is kmax = n(n−1)
2
, and if k = kmax, the Schouten tensor of
g, Schg has two eigenvalues λ and ν, where one of them, say λ, has multiplicity at least n −1.
If, in addition, λ ̸= 0, ν = ν(λ) and ν −λ ̸= 0, then g is radial.
Proof. As above, dilate g until the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor are less than 1/2. Now,
construct the horospherically convex hypersurface given by Theorem 2.1. The hypothesis on
the G−invariance of g is translated into a T −invariance of φ under a k−parameter subgroup
T ≤I(Hn+1). Thus, applying now [6, Theorem 4.7] we obtain the result.
Remark 5.1. The above results hold for n ≥3. It is clear that for n = 2 are false.

A note on rotational hypersurfaces in Hn+1
In a recent paper [10], authors have classiﬁed all possible radial solution to the equation
σk(λi) = c, c ≡constant,
that is, they consider conformal metrics g = v(|x|)−2|dx|2 on domains of the form
{x ∈Rn, r1 < |x| < r2} ,
being σk(λi) the k−th elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of Schg, and 0 ≤r1 <
r2 ≤∞.
From the point of view of hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space, this classiﬁcation result means
(up to possibly a dilatation) that they have classiﬁed all rotational horospherically convex hy-
persurfaces verifying the Weingarten relationship
σk
 1 + κi
2(1 −κi)

= ˜c, ˜c ≡constant.
It will be too long to describe here all these solutions, but we would like to mention two cases
when c > 0: Case I.1 and Case I.3.a in [10, Theorem 1] give the existence of hyperspheres
(which was already known) and Delaunay-type hypersurfaces respectively.

Remark 6.1. An interesting application of the above hypersurfaces could be to use them as
barriers for Plateau problem at inﬁnity in the hyperbolic space for certain Weingarten func-
tionals.
