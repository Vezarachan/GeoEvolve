Interpolation and internal painting are one of the basic approaches in image internal painting, 
which is used to eliminate undesirable parts that occur in digital images or to enhance faulty 
parts. This study was designed to compare the interpolation algorithms used in image in-
painting in the literature. Errors and noise generated on the colour and grayscale formats of 
some of the commonly used standard images in the literature were corrected by using Cubic, 
Kriging, Radial based function and High dimensional model representation approaches and the 
results were compared using standard image comparison criteria, namely, PSNR (peak signal-
to-noise ratio), SSIM (Structural SIMilarity), Mean Square Error (MSE). According to the 
results obtained from the study, the absolute superiority of the methods against each other was 
not observed. However, Kriging and RBF interpolation give better results both for numerical 
data and visual evaluation for image in-painting problems with large area losses.

1. Introduction 
When analogue cameras were widely used, the photographs we kept in print were at risk of 
aging, fading, wear, and thus loss of information. With the advent of digital cameras, the 
development of computer and storage, and even cloud storage, our habit of storing photographs 
in print has evolved accordingly. However, this did not eliminate the risk of information loss 
of our photos. Errors or loss of information were observed in digital photographs during the 
acquisition and transmission of the photograph. Some of these may be related to the direct 
quality of the photograph, such as blur and noise, and in some cases, loss of information in 
certain areas of the picture. In addition, there may be errors such as the unintentional 
incorporation of undesirable objects into the photo frame during the photo shoot.  
 
Some methods have been developed due to requirements such as eliminating the lack of 
information in photographs or eliminating unwanted areas. Bertalmio et al. (2000) developed 
in-painting terminology. In-painting is the art of modifying a picture or video in a way that 
cannot be easily detected by an ordinary observer and has become a major research area in 
image processing (Bugeau et al. 2010). The missing or undesirable portion of the image is 
completed by using intensity levels on adjacent pixels. However, the image in-painting will not 
be able to restore the original form of the missing part in the picture, it will only fill the missing 
or undesirable parts, close to the original (Amasidha et al. 2016). 
 
The methods developed for in-painting can be grouped under three main headings. 
 
 Texture synthesis: The basis of this approach is the self-similarity principle. It is based 
on the assumption that similar structures in a picture are often repeated (Bugeau et al. 
2010). 
 Exemplar-based approach: The missing region is filled with information from the 
known region at the patch level. 
 Partial differential equations and variation-based diffusion techniques: The 
method of partial differential equations fills the regions to be uniformly propagated 
along the isophot directions from neighboring regions along the direction of isophot. 
The method, which gives good results for small areas, causes turbidity in larger areas. 
Variation methods address the problem in the form of finding the extremes of energy 

functions. However, these models only aim at dealing with non-textural in-painting. The 
difficulty of real in-painting problems is due to the rapid changes of the isophot and the 
roughness of the image functions (Chang and Chongxiu 2011). 
 
In addition to this, methods have been developed that consider interiors as an interpolation 
problem and apply different interpolation techniques to complete the missing areas in the 
images (Guzel, 2015 and Mutlu et. al., 2014).  
 
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the interpolation methods to handle the image in-painting 
process as an interpolation problem as the main contribution. State-of-the-art methods were 
tested on a generated dataset which was subject to both noise and corruption. These methods 
were then assessed based on their SSIM, PNSR and MSE in a quantitative evaluation. A 
qualitative evaluation was also performed on the results to ensure that the interpolation 
approach yielded visually appealing images (Bostanci, 2014 and Seref et. al, 2021). 
 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the current literature and 
background on the interpolation approaches employed in the paper. This section is followed by 
Section 3 where the dataset and the evaluation approach is elaborated. Section 4 presents both 
quantitative and qualitative results, finally the paper is concluded in Section 5. 
 
 
2. Literature Review and Background 
2.1 Cubic Interpolation 
This interpolation is one of the common methods used to estimate unknown points. It generates 
results with smoother transitions and lower error rate than other interpolation techniques with 
polynomials. It is a commonly used method for filling lost pixels. When an interpolation of 
surface values is desired in a two-dimensional field, it can be formulated as follows. 
 
On a unit square, if the surface values at the corners and the partial derivative values at these 
points are known, the convergence values of the points within the square can be obtained by 
polynomial (1)

replacing the required equations with unknown coefficients for 
ija  which can be solved using 
matrix format to express the polynomial exactly. 
 
2.2 Kriging Interpolation 
Kriging is a geostatistics interpolation method that takes into account the distance and degree 
of variation between known points when estimating values at unknown points (Firas and Jassim 
2013). This approach uses the values of the entire sample to calculate an unknown value. 
Kriging assumes that the distance or direction between sample points reflects a spatial 
correlation that can be used to explain variation on the surface. In kriging interpolation, a 
mathematical function is applied to all points of a specified number or a specified radius to 
determine the estimation value of each unknown point. The closer the point is, the higher value 
the weights have. Kriging is the most appropriate approach when there is a spatially related 
distance or directional trend in the data (spatial auto-correlation) and calculated as follows:

Two steps are required for Kriging interpolation:  
1. Dependency rules: Constructing variograms and covariance functions to predict statistical 
dependence (spatial autocorrelation) based on the autocorrelation model (fitting a model). 
The Variogram is a function of distance and direction that separates the two positions used to 
measure dependence. Variogram is defined as the variance of the difference between two 
variables at two different points and is calculated as:

2. Estimation: Estimating unknown values.  
 
The data is used twice to perform these two steps. 
 
Jassim (2013) creates damaged images by using 4 different masks on 10 different grayscale 
images and uses Kriging interpolation to remove them. Sapkal and Kadbe (2016) also do in-
painting using Kriging interpolation. In this study, the results are obtained by using the same 
masks on 5 different grayscale images. 
 
Sapkal et al. (2016) used Kriging interpolation to remove several types of masks. In the study, 
the same dataset was used with a different set of masks. 
 
Awati et al. (2017) conducted a study on troubleshooting colour images using modified Kriging 
interpolation. They separate colour images into RGB components and apply separate 
interpolation to each component. In practice, 3x3 matrices are used. The masks they use consist 
of vertical, horizontal and curved lines. They make separate trials for 1,2,3 and 4 pixel 
thicknesses as line thicknesses in each mask and evaluate the results. 
 
2.3 Radial Basis Functions 
Chang and Chongxiu (2011) define a mapping between the coordinates and colours of the 
image pixels, and implement an algorithm based on radial-based functions to generate the best 
approximation of this mapping in a given neighborhood. Radial-based functions are means of 
approximating a multivariable function as a linear combination of univariate functions. It is one 
of the methods that provides good results for the interpolation of scattered data. In order to 
increase the accuracy of their solutions and reduce the complexity of the algorithm, researchers 
create the pixel-by-pixel zoom function. For larger loss areas, interpolation of different 
overlapping coefficients is used. 
 
Wang and Qin (2006) propose an algorithm for image in-painting based on compactly 
supported radial basis functions (CSRBF). The algorithm transforms the 2-D image in-painting 
problem from a 3-D point set into a surface reconstruction problem. First, a covered surface is 
constructed for approximation to the set of dots obtained from the damaged image using radial 
based functions. The values of the lost pixels are then calculated using this surface. 
 
2.4 High Dimensional Model Representation and Lagrange Interpolation 
Karaca and Tunga (2016), who consider image in-painting as an interpolation problem, have 
designed this problem by using the HDMR method and Lagrange interpolation, which allows 
a multivariate function to be expressed as the sum of multiple functions with less variables.  
 
Normally grayscale images are represented as functions with two variables 
( , )
f x y , :x  number 
of rows, :
y number of columns. Similarly, coloured images are represented by a function of 
three variables 
( , , )
f x y z . In order to apply HDMR, the copy of the image itself is added as an 

additional dimension. In other words, a grayscale image, 
( , , )
f x y n , 
1,2
n 
; and the colour 
image is expressed as 
( , , , )

In general, functions are represented up to univariate or bivariate functions, and the remainder 
is ignored as an approximation error. The function created for grayscale images can be fully 
represented when it is extended up to two-variable functions in the HDMR expansion (Altın 
and Tunga 2014). The researchers presented a representation by making up to three variable 
functions for in-painting with colour images and aimed to estimate the lost pixels by applying 
them with Lagrange interpolation. 
 
In another study, Karaca and Tunga (2016) also studied the in-painting of a rectangular area 
using the same method. They tried 5x5, 10x10 and 20x20 pixel dimensions on different images 
for the in-painting area. 
 
The algorithms used for in-painting in the literature have also been used for noise removal. 
Jassim (2013) tried the Kriging algorithm for salt & pepper noise reduction. For noise of 
varying intensity, it first detects noise using an 8x8 pixel filter on the image, and then applies 
Kriging interpolation to correct incorrect pixel values in this area. 
 
3. Material and Method 
3.1 Material 
The internally stained images obtained from the methods used in the studies and their originals 
were presented with PSNR and SSIM criteria. In addition, although the masks used in the 
studies seem similar to each other, they have differences. This is a limitation for the exact 
comparison of algorithms. In order to make a full comparison of the algorithms proposed in 
this part of the study, we compared the results obtained by using the same masks and images 
and each of the methods. 
 
256x256 grayscale and colour images were used to compare the algorithms. The images used 
were selected from the images commonly used in image processing research: Lena, Mandril, 
Peppers, Jetplane and House. The masks applied to the images are created as follows: 
 Mask 1: simple curve, drawn with 4 pixel-thick pencil 
 Mask 2: A non-condensed font consisting of several lines between 12-19 fonts, 
 Mask 3: Intense font created with 12 font letters, 
 Mask 4: Intense scratches of oblique, horizontal and vertical lines drawn with a 4-
pixel-thick pencil, 
 Mask 5: Frame created with a size of 40x40 pixels. 
In addition, to test the noise reduction efficiency of interpolation methods, masks created with 
salt & pepper noise were applied. Their density levels are Noise 1: 10%, Noise 2: 30%, Noise 
3: 50%, Noise 4: 70% and Noise 5: 90%, respectively. For instance, the presentation of the 
grayscale Lena image with the masks to be used is demonstrated in Table 1.

Noise 1: 10% 
Noise 2: 30% 
Noise 3: 50% 
Noise 4: 70% 
Noise 5: 90% 
 
In all of the algorithms, corrected images were obtained by calculating only unknown pixel 
values and the obtained images were compared with the original image using PSNR (peak 
signal-to-noise ratio) and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) criteria. In order to determine the 
unknown pixel values, the difference between the pixel values between the original image and 
the false image was taken and the non-0 pixel values were tried to be estimated by the 
algorithms. In the comparison of the results with the actual image, the mean square error (MSE), 
which is a part of the SSIM and PSNR criteria, is indicated. 
 
3.2 Method 
The evaluation presented in this study employs a number of various interpolation techniques, 
namely, Two-dimensional cubic interpolation, Kriging interpolation, Interpolation with radial 
based functions (RBF), Interpolation using High Dimensional Model Representation. These 
techniques are detailed in the following.  
 
3.2.1 Two-dimensional cubic interpolation 
For this method, x, y: row, column coordinate values of known pixels, v: pixel values, xq, yq: 
coordinate values of the desired pixels, cubic: to be used as input parameters for the 
interpolation. After the information of the two-dimensional image is put into the form that the 
function can use, the function is executed and the new pixel values are updated. 
 
3.2.2 Kriging interpolation 
For this method, kriging (xi, yi, zi, x, y) and auxiliary functions presented by Schwanghart and 
Kuhn (2010) were used (xi, yi: row, column coordinate values of known pixels, zi: pixel values, 
x, y: to be the value of the coordinate values of the desired pixels). 256x256 pixel images were 
used along with masks of size 16x16 pixels masks and noise densities defined in 8x8 pixels 
neighbourhood. The unknown values in each sub-image were calculated using Kriging 
function.  
 
In this way, it is ensured that the unknown points in the sub-images are related to all pixel 
values in the sub-images. The 8x8 pixel size has enough data for noise reduction. However, the 
Kriging algorithm did not work for Noise5 with a 90% density (see Table 1). Therefore, only 
16x16 pixels are used for Noise5. On the other hand, although the calculation method by sub-
images is suitable for scattered errors, it will not be suitable for an internal painting problem as 
in Mask5. Therefore, for the case in Mask5, the image in-painting is reduced to a 90x90 pixel 
image size that will take the center of the lost frame area (40x40 pixels) and the function is run 
on this 90x90 pixel neighbourhood.  
 
3.2.3 Interpolation with radial based functions (RBF) 
The approach of (Foster 2009) was adopted in order to compute the RBF function in a similar 
fashion with the Kriging interpolation where subimages are used for the computation. 
 
3.2.4 Interpolation using High Dimensional Model Representation  
For this method, following the approach of Tunga and Koçanoğulları (2017) study; constant, 
one-variable and two-variable functions representing grayscale images; The fixed, one, two and 
three variable functions representing the coloured images were found and the missing areas on 
these functions were corrected by interpolation approach. In this section, spline for interpolation 
of one-dimensional functions and cubic interpolation for interpolation of two-dimensional 
functions were implemented. 

 
These methods can be applied directly to grayscale images which can be expressed as two 
variable functions. Interpolation of coloured images were obtained by applying the above 
interpolations separately to the three layers of the images. At this point, there is no difference 
between the method applied to grayscale images. For the calculations, the same algorithms were 
applied to the red, green, blue (RGB) layers three times and then combined to produce corrected 
colour images.  
 
4. Results 
In-painting results were obtained using the various interpolation methods discussed above. All 
the results obtained for a sample are presented in Figures 1 (in grayscale) and 2 (in colour). 
 
The numerical comparison results obtained from all images are summarized in Table 2 for 
grayscale and in Table 3 for colour images. The results of two-dimensional cubic interpolation, 
Kriging interpolation, RBF interpolation and YBMG interpolation are shown in four large 
blocks. Orange, blue, green intracellular staining was used to compare the outputs of the four 
methods. For example, in the PSNR values of 4 different methods used to remove Mask 1 in 
the colour Lena image, 2-dimensional cubic interpolation has the highest value. This cell was 
stained with orange. The highest SSIM values of the four methods were painted with blue, 
while the lowest MSE values of the four methods were painted with green. By means of this 
staining, it is better to observe which method gives better results in which situation. 
 
In addition, the data of four different methods were compared with the one-way ANOVA test 
to determine whether there was a difference between the methods in terms of PSNR, MSE and 
SSIM. There was no difference between the methods in terms of PSNR, MSE and SSIM values 
in the evaluation (p = 0.997, p = 0.998, p = 0.986 for gray images, p = 0.974, p = 0.994, p = for 
gray images, respectively). 0988). 
 
In addition, in order to compare the numerical results of the four methods, the difference 
between the maximum value and the smallest value of the PSNR and SSIM results obtained for 
each image and mask was attempted to be observed as a percentage change. These ratios are 
presented as Figures 3 and 4. 
 
PSNR and MSE values are directly related to each other. As it is known, the MSE value is part 
of the PSNR criterion. The PSNR value is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the square 
root of MSE (5) Therefore, it is essential to have the lowest MSE when PSNR is highest.

In addition, the formula of MSE (6) is built on differences in density levels between the two 
images.

In other words, the closer the pixel values in the same position in the two images are, the closer 
the MSE value is to 0. We understand that the smaller the MSE value and the higher the PSNR, 
the better the results. On the other hand, the SSIM criterion was formulated to measure 
luminance, contrast and structural correlation between the two images. The results obtained 
from functions comparing these three criteria separately are multiplied to find the SSIM value. 
Each function takes values in the range 0-1, as a result SSIM has values from 0 to 1. The SSIM 
value approaches to unity when the correlations are high, i.e. the images are similar. Although 
the PSNR and SSIM calculations do not seem to be alike, there are studies showing that these 
are analytically related (Horé and Ziou 2010). Therefore, SSIM and PSNR values are expected 
to be higher in a well obtained in-painting. 
 

As a result of this evaluation; In Table 2 and Table 3, it will be natural for the cells stained with 
orange, blue and green to coexist. However, in some cases it is observed that this association is 
not preserved, but this is due to very small differences that can be ignored. Therefore, the 
outputs we obtained do not contradict theoretical knowledge. 
 
For each image and method in Figure 3 and Figure 4, it was tried to observe the percentage 
change between the methods by the ratio of the highest and lowest obtained score differences 
to the lowest value. As can be observed here, the numerical comparison results for images 
obtained by in-painting are generally very close to each other. The difference in SSIM values 
does not exceed 5%. PSNR values are mostly within the 5% change band.  
 
In addition, according to the statistics obtained from the one-way ANOVA test, it was 
confirmed that there was no difference between the methods in numerical evaluation scales. 
Therefore, it is observed that the methods do not have absolute superiority to each other in 
terms of in-painting results. 
 
If the methods of application are taken into consideration, the in-painting problem in Mask 5 
will need to be evaluated separately. In other masks, the problem of internal painting is scattered 
throughout the image, where it focuses on a specific area. Therefore, in Kriging and RBF 
interpolation methods, we focused on the 90x90 pixel area in order to keep the lost area in the 
middle. It is considered that the selected area would provide sufficient data in order to fill the 
missing area.  
 
In fact, in the first trials, the whole image was tested using the Kriging and RBF functions at 
once for both the Mask 5 and the 4 other masks. However, the functions needed during the 
operation of the array and the required meshgrid structures that need to be produced. When the 
results obtained for Mask 5 are evaluated; it is observed that Kriging and RBF methods produce 
better outputs. On the other hand, this advantage will be determined in the evaluation made 
through observation. The results obtained in Mask 5 can be compared visually with the study 
of Karaca and Tunga (2016). It is observed that the results obtained for staining of the quadratic 
region are much larger than the MSE values.

According to the results, the square area is still clearly visible and filled with diagonal lines. In 
our results, the square area (for Kriging and RBF interpolation) was less prominent and no 
diagonal lines were observed in the faulty area. The difference between grayscale and colour 
images of the two studies may be inaccurate, but the interiors of in-painting characters can still 
be observed. Although relatively, the results obtained in our study can be more visually 
appealing.

5. Conclusion 
 
The literature lacks a detailed evaluation on the use of interpolation methods for the in-painting 
problem. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate state-of-the-art approaches, namely, two 
dimensional cubic, Kriging, RBF and YBMG based Lagrange interpolation methods, which are 
recently studied in the literature.  
 
A benchmark dataset was generated in order to perform a detailed evaluation of the in-painting 
algorithms. Several comprehensive experiments were conducted in order to make a fair 
assessment. According to the results obtained, it is observed that the methods do not have 
absolute superiority to each other in terms of in-painting results. However, Kriging and RBF 
interpolation produce better results both for numerical data and visual evaluation for image in-
painting problems having large area losses. Studies on this subject have also yielded good 
results for large area in-painting, but Kriging and RBF interpolation outputs look better in terms 
of visual quality.
