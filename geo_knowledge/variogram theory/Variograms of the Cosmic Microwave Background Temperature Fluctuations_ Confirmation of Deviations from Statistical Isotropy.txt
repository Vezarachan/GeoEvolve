ABSTRACT
The Standard Inﬂationary model predicts an isotropic distribution of the Cosmic Mi-
crowave Background temperature ﬂuctuations. Detection of deviations from statistical
isotropy would call for a revision of the physics of the early universe. This paper in-
troduces the variogram as a powerful tool to detect and characterize deviations from
statistical isotropy in Cosmic Microwave Background maps. Application to the Wilkin-
son Microwave Anisotropy Probe data clearly shows diﬀerences between the northern
and the southern hemispheres. The sill and range of the northern hemisphere’s vari-
ogram are lower than those of the southern hemisphere. Moreover the variogram for
the northern hemisphere lies outside the 99% c.l. for scales above ten degrees. Diﬀer-
ences between the northern and southern hemispheres in the functional dependence
of the variogram with the scale can be used as a validation bench mark for proposed
anisotropic cosmological models.

INTRODUCTION
The most recent observations of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) in combination with Large Scale Struc-
ture and High Redshift Supernova observations point toward
a model of the universe with an energy density dominated
by the Cosmological Constant, the so called concordance
model (Dunkley et al. 2009). This model relies on the as-
sumption of an early period of Inﬂation (Baumann & Peiris
2009). The Standard Inﬂationary model predicts a isotropic
Gaussian statistical distribution of the CMB ﬂuctuations.
Since the release of the ﬁrst year of data of the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite there has
been a substantial amount of work aimed at testing these
two predictions (see Cay´on 2007 for a list of works in real,
spherical harmonic and wavelet space). In particular devi-
ations from isotropy have been conﬁrmed in the three and
ﬁve years of WMAP data (Eriksen et al. 2007, Hansen et
al. 2009, Rath et al. 2007, Vielva et al. 2007, Monteser´ın et
al. 2008, Samal et al. 2008, Hoftuft et al. 2009). All these
deviations should be seriously considered as they might be
pointing toward the need to revise the physics behind the
processes that take place in the early universe.
This paper introduces the variogram as a statistical tool
to study the isotropy of CMB ﬂuctuations. The variogram is
a well known statistical method used in the analysis of spa-
tially distributed data Schabenger & Gotway 2005. It repre-
sents a direct method to estimate the correlation length of
a sample. Its graphical representation provides information
about the spatial continuity or roughness of a 2D image.
In particular this method has been extensively applied in
geostatistical analyses to quantify spatial variability (Clark
1979, Clark & Harper 2000, Gringarten & Deutsch 2001).
Sample variograms in diﬀerent directions are a conventional
practice for characterizing the correlation structure of geo-
logical images and for checking for their isotropy. Variograms
of CMB maps are shown to be easy to calculate and to in-
terpret. The scale dependence of the variogram is shown to
diﬀer between the northern and southern hemispheres for
the WMAP data revealing it as a powerful tool to validate
non-isotropic cosmological models.
This paper is organized as follows. The variogram is de-
ﬁned in Section 2. Application of variograms to the study of
CMB maps, in particular those provided by the WMAP mis-
sion, is addressed in Section 3. Statistical analysis of WMAP
in comparison to Monte Carlo simulations is presented in
Section 4. Section 5 is dedicated to discussion and conclu-
sions.

VARIOGRAM: DEFINITION AND
INTERPRETATION
Given a stationary random ﬁeld Z, the variogram for all
possible locations ⃗u is deﬁned as
2γ(⃗h) = E[(Z(⃗u) −Z(⃗u + ⃗h))2].

Where Z(⃗u) represents the value of the random ﬁeld at po-
sition ⃗u and ⃗h is the lag distance. γ is usually called the

in the ﬁeld at diﬀerent scales (lag distances). In particular

where C is the correlation function. The sill of the vari-
ogram corresponds to the value of the variogram for which
C(⃗h∗) = 0. The lag distance ⃗h∗is called the range. A var-
iogram that reaches a constant value for distances larger
than the range reﬂects lack of correlation at those scales.
Variograms represent a robust, fast and easy to implement
method to determine the correlation length of a given sample
without the need to compute the full correlation function.
A key question in geophysics and, as discussed in the
introduction, in cosmology/astrophysics, is to check for
whether the correlation structure in an image is isotropic or
not. The correlation structure in an image would be isotropic
if it depends only on the distance between two sites and
not on their relative orientation. A common practice in geo-

Variograms of the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Fluctuations: Conﬁrmation of Deviations from Sta
physics is to determine the variogram along diﬀerent direc-
tions (usually horizontal and vertical). Diﬀerences in the sill
and range of variograms in diﬀerent directions are indicators
of geologic variability. We discuss in the next section how to
implement this methodology in the study of statistical prop-
erties of CMB maps.

ANALYSIS OF CMB MAPS BASED ON
VARIOGRAMS
Observations of the CMB (maps) are distributed over the
surface of the sphere. Common applications of the variogram
methodology have been done on 2D ﬂat images. Here we
extend this statistical method to the analysis on the sphere
and present the application to WMAP maps (Hinshaw et al.
2009, ApJS, Hinshaw et al. 2007).
The value of the variogram for the CMB temperature
ﬂuctuations ∆T at a lag distance h is numerically calculated
as
2γ(h) = (1/Np)
X
⃗u
[(1/N(⃗u, h))
X
N(⃗u,h)
[∆T (⃗u)−∆T (⃗u+h)]2,(3)
where Np is the total number of central pixels (at position
⃗u). N(⃗u, h) indicates the number of pixels at a distance (an-
gular distance) h from the central pixel (at ⃗u). The expres-
sion above is usually referred to as the omni-directional var-
iogram.
Variograms for WMAP ⋆ﬁve year data are presented
in Figures 1-4. Solid lines indicate the value of the omni-
directional variograms. Figure 1 corresponds to the Inter-
nal Linear Combination map. Variograms for the individ-
ual frequency maps Q,V and W are presented in ﬁgures 2,3
and 4 respectively. In order to remove Galactic and point
source emission, we applied the KQ85 mask provided by the
WMAP team. Unless otherwise stated, only pixels outside
the mask enter the computation of the variogram (either
as central pixels or as pixels at a certain angular distance
from the central one.) The maps were originally downloaded
in the HEALpix† nested format at resolution nside = 512
(total number of pixels being 12 × nside2). Before the vari-
ograms were calculated we downgraded the maps to resolu-
tion nside = 32. The minimum lag distance is constrained
by the pixel size in that resolution. We calculate the var-
iogram at lag distances h between 150 arcmins and 1800
arcmins. In calculating the pixels that are at these distances
from the central pixel we include all pixels in a ring with a
lag tolerance of 30 arcmins (±30 arcmins around the ﬁxed
lag distance.) As one can see the sill of the variograms is be-
ing approached at scales above ∼1200 arcmins. There is no
diﬀerence in the scale dependence of the variogram among
all the maps considered.
The standard method used in geostatistics to look for
deviations from isotropy is to calculate the variogram in dif-
ferent directions. In applying this method to the analysis of
CMB images on the surface of a sphere we have slightly mod-
iﬁed the standard approach for considering diﬀerent direc-
tions. In order to look for deviations from isotropy we have
⋆Data has been downloaded from http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/
† HEALPix http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/
calculated variograms in diﬀerent regions of the sphere. In
galactic coordinates, the map was divided into the northern
and southern hemispheres. One can notice two main diﬀer-
ences between the two hemispheres. (1) The sill of the vari-
ogram corresponding to the northern hemisphere is reached
at a slight lower range than that of the southern hemisphere
and that of the entire map. (2) The value of the sill is lower
in the north than in the south, pointing to a lower value
of the variance. A similar trend is observed when the map
is divided into four regions corresponding to the northeast,
northwest, southeast and southwest (see the deﬁnition in
ﬁgure captions for Figures 1-4). The range and sill appear
to be the smallest for the northeast region. These results
indicate a diﬀerence in the behavior of the correlation func-
tion in between the northern and southern hemispheres. For
the northern hemisphere the correlation function drops to
nearly zero at scales above ∼900 and the variance is lower
than that for the southern hemisphere.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In order to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of the ob-
served anisotropy in the correlation function, we have deter-
mined the distribution of the variogram for full maps and
for diﬀerent regions of the sphere. The statistical distribu-
tion was built based on 10000 simulations following the same
procedure as in Cruz et al. 2007 and Vielva et al. 2004. The
data and the simulations correspond to a weighted linear
combination of WMAP Q, V and W bands (notice that the
data maps used in this analysis are not those corresponding
to the ILC provided by the WMAP team). These simula-
tions included the number of observations and receiver noise
dispersion corresponding to the three years of observations
of WMAP (as provided in the LAMBDA web site). At the
resolution (nside = 32) at which the analysis was performed
there should be no diﬀerence between three or ﬁve years of
data (one can compare the variograms for WMAP in ﬁgures
1 and 5).
Variograms for the northern and southern hemispheres
(galactic coordinates) are presented in Figure 5. The mean,
95% and 99% c.l. for the simulations are shown as solid,
dotted-dashed and dashed lines respectively. Results for
WMAP are denoted by stars. As one can see, the variogram
for the southern hemisphere perfectly follows the behavior of
the simulations. This is not the case for the northern hemi-
sphere. The variogram for the northern hemisphere deviates
from the expected value by more than 99% at scales above
600 arcmins. This is a consequence of lower range (lack of
correlation above that scale) and sill for WMAP in compar-
ison with the simulations.
Variograms for the four regions, northeast, northwest,
southeast, southwest, are shown in Figure 6. The results in-
dicate that variograms for both northern regions are at the
tails of the distribution. The range and sill for the northeast
are smaller than those for any of the other three regions indi-
cating that the north/south asymmetry could be originating
from that region.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The Standard Inﬂationary model predicts a universe that is
statistically homogeneous and isotropic. There have been a
number of works on detections of deviations from isotropy
based on analyses of the WMAP data (see references in the
introduction). In this paper we have introduced the vari-
ogram as a tool for detecting deviations from isotropy in
CMB maps. Variograms have been extensively used in geo-
logical applications in order to characterize the soil in diﬀer-
ent directions. The variogram provides an alternative, easy
to apply and easy to interpret method, to characterize the
correlation function of the CMB temperature ﬂuctuations.
Under the assumption of isotropy there should be no diﬀer-
ence in the behavior of the correlation function with direc-
tion.
Previous studies of the correlation function of the
WMAP data (Copi et al. 2009) have shown a lack of correla-

tion at scales above ∼60 deg. This agrees with the functional
dependence of the variogram observed in ﬁgures 1-4 and top
pannel of ﬁgure 5. The variogram of the WMAP data starts
converging toward a constant value at scales ∼30 deg with
an expected value of the range at the scales indicated by
the work of Copi et al. 2009. The functional dependence
of the variogram diﬀers from that expected in the corcon-
dance model as seen in ﬁgure 5. The WMAP data presents
shorter range and lower variance than the best ﬁt cosmolog-
ical model.
The variograms of the WMAP data clearly show diﬀer-
ences between the northern and southern hemisphere (see
upper panels in ﬁgures 1-4). The northern hemisphere has
lower sill and range than the southern hemisphere. This re-
sult points in the same direction as previous claims of lack
of large and intermediate scale ﬂuctuations in the northern
hemisphere (Eriksen et al. 2004, Hansen et al. 2004, Erik-
sen et al. 2005, Eriksen et al. 2007, Monteser´ın et al. 2008,
Hansen et al. 2009). Results presented in the lower panels of
Figures 1-4 are also indicative of a larger lack of correlation
in the northeast region in comparison with the other three
regions of the sphere. The observed trend in the variogram
is the same in the ILC map and the three band maps Q,V
and W indicating no frequency dependence.
Assessment of the statistical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings
discussed above was done based on the variogram distribu-
tion function obtained from 10000 simulations. Simulations
were performed assuming the concordance model and tak-

ing into account observational constraints from WMAP. The
variogram of the northern hemisphere is outside the 99%
c.l. for scales above ten degrees (see Figure 5). The scale
dependence of the variogram is clearly diﬀerent between the
northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere as well
as between the northern hemisphere and the simulations in
both hemispheres. The variogram for the WMAP data in
the northern hemisphere rises up to a scale of 300 arcmins,
leveling oﬀright above that scale. Variograms of the simu-
lations and of the WMAP data in the southern hemisphere
continue rising above 300 arcmins. The sill is directly related
to the variance and these results therefore conﬁrm a lower
variance in the northern hemisphere, mostly concentrated in
the northeast region.
This paper contributes to increase the evidence against
statistical isotropy in the WMAP data. Results from the
variogram are directly obtained in real space and easy to
interpret. The diﬀerence in functional shape (scale depen-
dence) of the variogram between the northern and southern
hemispheres can be a validation bench mark for the predic-
tions of non-isotropic cosmological models like some those
already considered in the literature (Jaﬀe et al. 2005, 2006,
Gordon et al. 2005, Ackerman et al. 2007). Consideration of
some of these models is left for a future paper.
