RAOUF FAKHFAKH
Abstract. Suppose Vν is the pseudo-variance function of the Cauchy-Stieltjes Kernel
(CSK) family K+(ν) generated by a non degenerate probability measure ν with support
bounded from above. We determine the formula for pseudo-variance function (or variance
function Vν in case of existence) under boolean additive convolution power. This formulas
is used to identify the relation between variance functions under Boolean Bercovici-Bata
Bijection between probability measures.
We also gives the connection between boolean
cumulants and variance function and we relate boolean cumulants of some probability mea-
sures to Catalan numbers and Fuss Catalan numbers.

1. Introduction
According to Weso lowski [12], the kernel families generated by a kernel k(x, θ) with gen-
erating measure ν is the set of probability measures
{k(x, θ)/L(θ) : θ ∈Θ} ,
where L(θ) =
R
k(x, θ)ν(dx) is the normalizing constant and ν is the generating mea-
sure. The theory of natural exponential families (NEFs) is based on the exponential kernel
k(x, θ) = exp(θx).
The theory of Cauchy-Stieltjes Kernel (CSK) families is recently in-
troduced and it arises from a procedure analogous to the deﬁnition NEFs by using the
Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel 1/(1 −θx) instead of the exponential kernel. Bryc [1] initiated the
study of CSK families for compactly supported probability measures ν. He has shown that
such families can be parameterized by the mean and under this parametrization, the family
(and measure ν) is uniquely determined by the variance function V (m) and the mean m0
of ν. He also describe the class of quadratic CSK families. This class consists of the free
Meixner distributions. A formula for variance function under free additive convolution power
is also given: that is for α > 0,
Vν⊞α(m) = αVν(m/α).
(1.1)
In [2], Bryc and Hassairi extend the results in CSK families to allow measures ν with un-
bounded support, providing the method to determine the domain of means, introducing the
“pseudo-variance” function that has no direct probabilistic interpretation but has similar
properties to the variance function. They have also introduced the notion of reciprocity be-
tween two CSK families by deﬁning a relation between the R-transforms of the corresponding
generating probability measure. This leads to describing a class of cubic CSK families (with
support bounded from one side) which is related to quadratic class by a relation of reci-
procity. A general description of polynomial variance function with arbitrary degree is given
in [4]. In particular, a complete resolution of cubic compactly supported CSK families is

given. Other properties and characterizations in CSK families regarding the mean of the
reciprocal and orthogonal polynomials are also given in [7] and [8].
On the other hand, authors in [9] introduce a new kind of convolution between probability
measures in the context of non-commutative probability theory with boolean independence:
the boolean additive convolution ⊎. It plays an important role in free probability theory.
However, it gained prominence in works by Biane, Belinschi and their collaborators ([6]), as it
turned out to be useful in analyzing properties of the much more important free convolution.
In this paper, we deal with additive boolean convolution from a point of view related to
CSK families. The variance function is the fundamental concept for NEFs and also for CSK
families. So, after a review of some facts regarding CSK families, we determine in section 2
the formula for variance function under additive boolean convolution power. This formula
is used to identify the relation between variance functions under Boolean Bercovici-Bata Bi-
jection between probability measures. In section 3, we give the connection between boolean
cumulants and variance function and we relate boolean cumulants of some probability mea-
sures to Catalan numbers and Fuss Catalan numbers.
2. Variance function and boolean additive convolution ⊎.
2.1. CSK families: Preliminaries and notations. The notations used in what follows
are the ones used in [2], [3], [4], [8] and [7].
Deﬁnition of CSK families. Let ν be a non-degenerate probability measure with support
bounded from above. Then
Mν(θ) =
Z
1
1 −θxν(dx)
(2.1)
is well deﬁned for all θ ∈[0, θ+) with 1/θ+ = max{0, sup supp(ν)} and
K+(ν) = {P(θ,ν)(dx) : θ ∈(0, θ+)} = {Q(m,ν)(dx) : m ∈(m0(ν), m+(ν))}
is the one-sided CSK family generated by ν. That is,
P(θ,ν)(dx) =
1
Mν(θ)(1 −θx)ν(dx)
and Q(m,ν)(dx) is the corresponding parametrization by the mean, which is given by Q(m,ν)(dx) =
fν(x, m)ν(dx), with
fν(x, m) :=


(2.2)
and which involves the pseudo-variance function Vν(m) introduced later on.
Domain of means. The interval (m0(ν), m+(ν)) is called the (one sided) domain of means,
and is determined as the image of (0, θ+) under the strictly increasing function kν(θ) =
R
xP(θ,ν)(dx) which is given by the formula
kν(θ) = Mν(θ) −1
θMν(θ) .
(2.3)
From [2, Remark 3.3] we read out the following: for a non-degenerate probability measure ν
with support bounded from above, deﬁne
B(ν) = max{0, sup supp(ν)} = 1/θ+ ∈[0, ∞).
(2.4)

Then the one-sided domain of means (m0(ν), m+(ν)) of is determined from the following
formulas
m0(ν) = lim
θ→0+ kν(θ)
(2.5)
and for B = B(ν),
m+(ν) = B −lim
z→B+
1
Gν(z),
(2.6)
with Cauchy transform Gν(.) given by
Gν(z) =
Z
1
z −xν(dx).
(2.7)
Remark 2.1. One may deﬁne the one-sided CSK family for a generating measure with
support bounded from below. Then the one-sided CSK family K−(ν) is deﬁned for θ−< θ <
0, where θ−is either 1/A(ν) or −∞with A = A(ν) = min{0, inf supp(ν)}. In this case, the
domain of the means for K−(ν) is the interval (m−(ν), m0(ν)) with m−(ν) = A −1/Gν(A).
If ν has compact support, the natural domain for the parameter θ of the two-sided CSK
family K(ν) = K+(ν) ∪K−(ν) ∪{ν} is θ−< θ < θ+.
Variance and pseudo-variance functions. The variance function
Vν(m) =
Z
(x −m)2Q(m,ν)(dx)
(2.8)
is the fundamental concept of the theory of NEF, and also of the theory of CSK families
as presented in [1]. Unfortunately, if ν does not have the ﬁrst moment (which is the case
for 1/2-stable law), all measures in the CSK family generated by ν have inﬁnite variance.
Therefore, authors in [2] introduce the pseudo-variance function Vν(.). It is easy to describe
explicitly if m0(ν) =
R
xdν is ﬁnite. Then, see [2, Proposition3.2] we know that
Vν(m)
m
= Vν(m)
m −m0
.
(2.9)
In particular, Vν = Vν when m0(ν) = 0. In general,
Vν(m)
m
=
1
ψν(m) −m,
(2.10)
where ψν : (m0(ν), m+(ν)) →(0, θ+) is the inverse of the function kν(·). The generating
measure ν is determined uniquely by the pseudo-variance function Vν through the following
identities (for technical details, see [2]). if
z = z(m) = m + Vν(m)
m
(2.11)
then the Cauchy transform satisﬁes
Gν(z) =
m
Vν(m).
(2.12)
The eﬀects of aﬃne transformations. Here we collect formulas that describe the eﬀects
on the corresponding CSK family of applying an aﬃne transformation to the generating
measure. For δ ̸= 0 and γ ∈R, let f(ν) be the image of ν under the aﬃne map x 7−→
(x −γ)/δ. In other words, if X is a random variable with law ν then f(ν) is the law of
(X −γ)/δ, or f(ν) = D1/δ(ν ⊞δ−γ), where Dr(µ) denotes the dilation of measure µ by a

4
RAOUF FAKHFAKH
number r ̸= 0, i.e. Dr(µ)(U) = µ(U/r).
The eﬀects of the aﬃne transformation on the corresponding CSK family are as follows :
• Point m0 is transformed to (m0 −γ)/δ. In particular, if δ < 0, then f(ν) has support
bounded from below and then it generates the left-sided K−(f(ν)).
• For m close enough to (m0 −γ)/δ the pseudo-variance function is
Vf(ν)(m) =
m
δ(mδ + γ)Vν(δm + γ).
(2.13)
In particular, if the variance function exists, then
Vf(ν)(m) = 1
δ2Vν(δm + γ).
A special case worth noting is the reﬂection f(x) = −x. If ν has support bounded from above
and its right-sided CSK family K+(ν) has domain of means (m0, m+) and pseudo-variance
function Vν(m), then f(ν) generates the left-sided CSK family K−(f(ν)) with domain of
means (−m+, −m0) and the pseudo-variance function Vf(ν)(m) = Vν(−m).
2.2. Variance function under boolean additive convolution power. For a probability
measure ν on R, its Cauchy transform Gν is deﬁned by (2.7). Note that Gν maps C+ to
C−. The Boolean additive convolution is determined by the K-transform Kν of ν which is
deﬁned as
Kν(z) = z −
1
Gν(z),
for z ∈C+.
(2.14)
The function Kν is usually called self energy and it represent the analytic backbone of
boolean additive convolution. For two probability measures µ and ν, the additive Boolean
convolution µ ⊎ν is determined by
Kµ⊎ν(z) = Kµ(z) + Kν(z),
for z ∈C+,
(2.15)
and µ ⊎ν is again a probability measure.
The following result list properties of K-transform that we need.
Proposition 2.2. Suppose Vν is the pseudo-variance function of the CSK family K+(ν)
generated by a non degenerate probability measure ν with b = sup supp(ν) < ∞. Then
(i) Kν is strictly decreasing on (b, +∞).
(ii) For m ∈(m0(ν), m+(ν))
Kν (m + Vν(m)/m) = m.
(2.16)
(iii)
lim
z−→B+ Kν(z) = m+(ν), with B = B(ν) given by (2.4).
(iv)
lim
z−→+∞Kν(z) = m0(ν) ≥−∞.
Proof. (i) For a probability measure ν with support in (−∞, b], Gν is analytic on the slit
complex plane C \ (−∞, b]. This shows that a probability measure ν with support bounded
from above is determined uniquely by Gν(z) on z ∈(b, +∞) for some b. This, together with
(2.14) shows that a probability measure ν with support bounded from above is determined
uniquely by Kν(z) on z ∈(b, + ∞). From [2, Proposition 3.7], we have for b < z1 < z2
Gν(z1) −Gν(z2) > (z2 −z1)Gν(z1)Gν(z2).
(2.17)
Then, (2.17) say 1/Gν(z2) −1/Gν(z1) > z2 −z1. This implies that Kν(z2) −Kν(z1) < 0.

(ii) From [2, Proposition 3.3], let
z = z(m) = m + Vν(m)/m.
We have that m 7−→z(m) is continuous strictly decreasing on (m0, m+), z(m) > 0 on
(m0, m+), z(m) ր ∞as m ց m0 and z(m) ց B as m ր m+.
In addition from [2,
Proposition 3.5], the Cauchy transform satisﬁes (2.12). For m ∈(m0(ν), m+(ν)), equations
(2.14) and (2.12) implies that
Kν (m + Vν(m)/m) = m + Vν(m)/m −1/Gν (m + Vν(m)/m) = m.
(iii) From (2.14) and (2.6) (se also [2, Proposition 3.4]) we see that
lim
z−→B+ Kν(z) =
lim
z−→B+ z −1/Gν(z) = B −lim
z→B+ 1/Gν(z) = m+(ν).
(iv) Since the limit exists by part (i), this is a consequence of (2.16), in fact:
lim
z−→+∞Kν(z) =
lim
m−→m0 Kν(m + Vν(m)/m) = m0(ν).

Denote by M the space of Borel probability measures on R. According to [9], we call a
probability measure ν ∈M is inﬁnitely divisible in the boolean sense, if for each n ∈R,
there exists νn ∈M such that
ν = νn ⊎..... ⊎νn
|
{z
}
n times
.
Note that all probability measure ν ∈M are ⊎-inﬁnitely divisible, see [9, Theorem 3.6].
Next, we determine the formula for pseudo-variance function (and variance function Vν in
case of existence) under boolean additive convolution power.
Theorem 2.3. Suppose Vν is the pseudo-variance function of the CSK family K+(ν) gener-
ated by a non degenerate probability measure ν with b = sup supp(ν) < ∞and mean m0(ν).
For α > 0, we have that:
(i) The support of ν⊎α is bounded from above.
(ii) For m close enough to αm0(ν),
Vν⊎α(m) = αVν(m/α) + m2(1/α −1).
(2.18)
Furthermore, if m0 < +∞, then the variance functions of the CSK families generated
by ν and ν⊎α exists and
Vν⊎α(m) = αVν(m/α) + m(m −αm0)(1/α −1).
(2.19)
Proof. (i) For measure ν with support bounded from above by b > 0, Gν is analytic on the
slit complex plane C \ (−∞, b]. We have that {x ∈(supp ν)c; Gν(x) ̸= 0} ⊂(supp ν)c (see
[11, Lemma 2.1]. This implies that Kν and so Kν⊎α are well deﬁned on a subset of (supp ν)c.
So Gν⊎α(z) is well deﬁned and analytic on a subset of (b, +∞). Then the support of ν⊎α is
bounded from above.
(ii) We see that m0(ν⊎α) = αm0(ν). This follows from proposition 2.2(iv) and the additive
property of the K-transform. So for m close enough to αm0(ν) so that m/α ∈(m0(ν), m+(ν))
and m + Vν⊎α(m)/m ∈(b, +∞), we can apply (2.16) and the additive property of the K-
transform to see that

Since Kν is strictly decreasing on (b, +∞), this implies that
m + Vν⊎α(m)
m
= m/α + Vν(m/α)
m/α
,
which is nothing but (2.18). Furthermore, if m0 < +∞, then the variance functions of the
CSK families K+(ν) and K+(ν⊎α) exists and relation (2.19) follows from (2.9) and (2.18).

Remark 2.4. Let ν =
1
2δ−1 + 1
2δ1 be the symmetric Bernoulli distribution, its Cauchy
transform and self energy are respectively
Gν(z) =
z
z2 −1
and
Kν(z) = 1
z.
With B(ν) = max{0, sup supp(ν)} = 1, we have from Proposition 2.2(iii)
m+(ν) = lim
z−→1 Kν(z) = 1.
Consider µ = ν⊎2, then we have Kµ(z) = Kν⊎2(z) = 2Kν(z) = 2/z and Gµ(z) =
z
z2−2. So
µ = 1

2.
This implies that m+(ν⊎2) ̸= 2m+(ν). So there is no ”simple formula” for m+ under additive
boolean convolution power. For this reason, in theorem 2.3 we restrict ourself to m close
enough to αm0(ν).
Proposition 2.5. Suppose Vν is the pseudo-variance function of the CSK family K+(ν)
generated by a non degenerate probability measure ν with b = sup supp(ν) < ∞and mean
m0(ν), then for α > 0 measure
να := D1/α(ν⊎α)
(2.20)
has also support bounded from above and there is ε > 0 such that the pseudo-variance function
of the one sided CSK family generated by να is
Vνα(m) = Vν(m)/α + (1/α −1)m2,
for all m ∈(m0, m0 + ε).
Proof. It follows easily from (2.18) and (2.13).

The following result gives formulas for pseudo-variance functions (and variance functions
in case of existence) under both free additive convolution and boolean additive convolution
power.

α > 0 such that probability measures
 ν⊞1/α⊎α and
 ν⊎1/α⊞α are well deﬁned, their support

respectively, for m close enough to m0. Furthermore, if m0 < +∞, then the variance func-
tions of the CSK families generated respectively by ν,
 ν⊞1/α⊎α and
 ν⊎1/α⊞α exists and
for m close enough to m0 we have
V(ν⊞1/α)
⊎α(m) = Vν(m) + (1/α −1)m(m −m0).
(2.23)
and
V(ν⊎1/α)
⊞α(m) = Vν(m) + (1 −1/α)m(m −m0).
(2.24)
Proof. If ν is a probability measure with support bounded from above, then ν⊞1/α, for α > 0,
has also support bounded from above (see [2, Proposition 3.10] or [5, Proposition 6.1]). This
implies that
 ν⊞1/α⊎α has support bounded from above. In addition
V(ν⊞1/α)
⊎α(m)
=
αVν⊞1/α(m/α) + (1/α −1)m2
=
Vν(m) + (1/α −1)m2.
Furthermore, if m0 < +∞, then the variance functions of the CSK families K+(ν) and
K+
 ν⊞1/α⊎α
exists and relation (2.23) follows from (2.9) and (2.21).
The same arguments are used for probability measure
 ν⊎1/α⊞α to get formulas (2.22)
and (2.24).

2.3. Relation with Boolean Bercovici-Bata Bijection. Authors in [10] consider the
transformation Bt : M 7−→M deﬁned by, for every t ≥0
Bt(µ) =
 µ⊞(1+t)⊎
1
1+t ,
µ ∈M.
(2.25)
They prove that for t = 1 the transformation B1 coincides with the canonical bijection
B : M 7−→MInf−div discovered by Bercovici and Pata in their study of the relations between
inﬁnite divisibility in free and in Boolean probability. Here MInf−div stands for the set of
probability distributions in M which are inﬁnitely divisible with respect to the operation ⊞.
As a consequence, we have that Bt(µ) is ⊞-inﬁnitely divisible for every µ ∈M and every
t ≥1. The following result gives the pseudo-variance function (and variance function in case
of existence) of Bt(µ). In fact this easily follows from (2.21) and (2.23) by choosing α =
1
1+t.
Proposition 2.7. Suppose Vν is the pseudo-variance function of the CSK family K+(ν)
generated by a non degenerate probability measure ν with support bounded from above. For
t ≥0, the probability measure
Bt(ν) =
 ν⊞(1+t)⊎
1
1+t
(2.26)
has support bounded from above and it generates the CSK family with pseudo-variance func-
tion
VBt(ν)(m) = Vν(m) + tm2.
(2.27)
Furthermore, if m0 < +∞, then the variance functions of the CSK families generated by ν
and Bt(ν) exists and
VBt(ν)(m) = Vν(m) + tm(m −m0).
(2.28)
Denote by V the class of variance functions corresponding to probability measures ν such
that ν is compactly supported, centered:
R
xν(dx) = 0, with variance
R
x2ν(dx) = 1, so that
Vν(0) = 1. Denote by V∞the class of those V ∈V that the function m 7→V (cm) is in V
for every real c. It was proved in [4, Corollary 1.1], that the map V (m) 7→V (m) −m2 is a

8
RAOUF FAKHFAKH
bijection of V∞onto V (also the map Vν(m) 7−→Vν(m)+m2 is the inverse bijection). We will
see that this bijection between variance functions coincide with the boolean Bercovici-Bata
bijection.
Proposition 2.8. Suppose Vν(.) is the variance function of the CSK family generated by
a non degenerate probability measure ν with mean 0 and variance 1. For α > 0 such that
probability measures
 ν⊞1/α⊎α and
 ν⊎1/α⊞α are well deﬁned, we have
(i) The bijection Vν(m) 7−→Vν(m)+m2 from V onto V∞correspond to Boolean Bercovici-
Bata bijection between probability measures ν 7−→B1(ν), in addition
 ν⊎1/α⊞α α→+∞

(2.29)
(ii) The bijection Vν(m) 7−→Vν(m) −m2 from V∞onto V correspond to the inverse

dition

(2.30)
Proof. (i) It is clear from (2.28) that the bijection between variance functions Vν(m) 7−→
Vν(m) + m2 is in fact the celebrated Boolean Bercovici-Bata bijection B1(.). This bijection
is given by the explicit formula between probability measures ν 7−→B1(ν) =
 ν⊞2⊎1
2. On
the other hand, one see from (2.24) that
lim
α→+∞V(ν⊎1/α)
⊞α(m) = Vν(m) + m2 = VB1(ν)(m),
which implies (2.29).
(ii) The inverse Boolean Bercovici-Bata bijection is also explicit and takes two forms: the
bijection between variance functions Vν(m) 7−→Vν(m) −m2 correspond to inverse Boolean
Bercovici-Bata bijection between probability measures ν 7−→B−1
1 (ν) = (ν⊎2)⊞1
2. On the
other hand, one see from (2.23) that
lim
α→+∞V(ν⊞1/α)
⊎α(m) = Vν(m) −m2 = VB−1
1 (ν)(m),
which implies (2.30).

3. Boolean cumulants and variance functions
If ν is a compactly supported probability measure on the real line, the K-transform Kν
of ν admit a Laurent expansion. From [9], one sees that
Kν(z) =

n=1
rn(ν) 1
zn−1.
(3.1)
The coeﬃcients rn = rn(ν) are called the boolean cumulants of the measure ν. In particular
r0 = 0, r1 =
R
xν(dx) = m0. The following result gives the connection between boolean
cumulants and variance functions of CSK families.
Theorem 3.1. Suppose Vν is analytic in a neighborhood of m0, Vν(m0) > 0, and ν is a
probability measure with ﬁnite all moments, such that
R
xν(dx) = m0. Then the following
conditions are equivalent.

According to [1, Theorem 3.3], the boolean cumulants rn+1 of ν are in fact the free cumu-
lants of the probability measure B1(ν). This implies that B1(ν) is non degenerate, com-
pactly supported and there exists an interval (α, β) ∋m0 such that {Q(m,B1(ν))(dx) =
fB1(ν)(x, m)B1(ν)(dx)
:
m ∈(α, β)} deﬁne a family of probability measures parameter-
ized by the mean with variance function VB1(ν)(.). Applying the inverse Boolean Bercovici-
Bata bijection to B1(ν), then the probability measure ν = B−1
1 (B1(ν)) is non degenerate,
compactly supported and there exists an interval (A, B) ∋m0 such that {Q(m,ν)(dx) =
fν(x, m)ν(dx) : m ∈(A, B)} deﬁne a family of probability measures parameterized by the
mean with variance function Vν(.).

As pointed in the introduction the class of quadratic CSK families is described in [1,
Theorem 3.2]. This class consists of the free Meixner distributions.
We now relate boolean cumulants of the Marchenko Pastur distribution to Catalan num-
bers. The centered Marchenko-Pastur distribution is given by
ν(dx) =
p
4 −(x −a)2
2π(1 + ax)
1(a−2,a+2)(x)dx + p1δx1.
The discrete part is absent except for a2 > 1, in this case p1 = 1 −1/a2 and x1 = −1/a. It
generates the CSK family with variance function Vν(m) = 1 + am = Vν(m).
Corollary 3.2. If ν is the centered standardized Marchenko Pastur distribution with pa-
rameter a = 2, i.e.
it generates the CSK family with m0 = 0 and variance function
Vν(m) = 1 + 2m, then its boolean cumulants are r0 = 0, r1 = m0 = 0 and for n ≥1,
rn+1(ν) =
1
1 + n

2n

.

rn+1(ν) = 1

Authors in [4] introduce variance functions that are polynomial in the mean of arbitrary
degree. In particular a complete resolution of compactly supported CSK with cubic variance
function is given (see [4, Theorem 1.2]): Fix a, b, c ∈R. A cubic function
V (m) = 1 + am + bm2 + cm3
(3.10)
is in V if and only if (b + 1)3 ≥27c2. Furthermore, V is in V∞if and only if b3 ≥27c2.
We now relate boolean cumulants of certain probability distribution to Fuss-Catalan num-
bers.
Corollary 3.3. The function V (m) = 1 + 3m + 2m2 + m3 is the variance function the CSK
family generated by a compactly supported probability measure ν, with mean 0, variance 1
and with boolean cumulants given by:
rn+1(ν) =
1
3n + 1

3n + 1
n

.
(3.11)
Proof. The function V (m) = 1 + 3m + 2m2 + m3 correspond to (3.10) with a = 3, b = 2 and
c = 1. In this case we have (b + 1)3 ≥27c2 and this implies that the function V (m) is the
variance function the CSK family generated by a compactly supported probability measure
ν, with mean 0 and variance 1. Furthermore, from (3.2), the boolean cumulants of ν are the
Fuss Catalan numbers of order 3, that is
rn+1(ν) = 1

Combining (3.2) with the ⊎-L´evy-Khinchin formula, we get also the following.

VARIANCE FUNCTION OF BOOLEAN ADDITIVE CONVOLUTION.

Corollary 3.4. Suppose V (.) is analytic at 0, V (0) = 1. Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(i) There exists a probability measure ν with mean 0 and variance 1 such that V (.) is
the variance function of the CSK family generated by ν.
(ii) There exists a ﬁnite positive measure ρ such that

(3.12)
Proof. From [9, Proposition 3.2], Kν is a self energy function if and only if there exists a
ﬁnite positive measure ρ such that Kν is the Cauchy transform of ρ: that is
Kν(z) =
Z
1
z −xρ(dx).
(3.13)
Combining (3.13) with (3.2) and (3.1), this end the proof.
